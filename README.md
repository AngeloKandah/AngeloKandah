Going By Experience

A motorist was on trial for hitting a pedestrian.

His lawyer argued, 'Your Honor, my client has been driving for over twenty-five years.'

'Your Honor,' the plaintiff's lawyer retored, 'if this case is going to be judged by experience, may I remind you that my client has been walking for over fifty years!'
