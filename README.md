Geriatric Intermezzo

'Comrade Andropov is the most turned on man in Moscow!' 
'Comrade Andropov is sure to light up any discussion!' 
'Why did Brezhnev go abroad, and Andropov did not? Because Brezhnev ran on batteries, but Andropov needed an outlet.' (Reference to Brezhnev's pacemaker and Andropov's dialysis machine).
