Bill Clinton

One Friday morning, a teacher came up with a novel 
way to motivate her class. She told them that she 
would read a quote and the first student to correctly 
identify who said it would receive the rest of the 
day off. 

She started with 'This was England's finest hour.' 
Little Suzy instantly jumped up and said, ' Winston 
Churchill.' 

'Congratulations,' said the teacher 'you may go 
home.' 

The teacher then said, 'Ask not what your country can 
do for you.' 
Before she could finish this quote, another young 
lady belts out, 'John F. Kennedy'. 

'Very good' says the teacher, 'you may go.' 

Irritated that he has missed two golden 
opportunities, Little Johnny said, 'I wish those 
girls would just shut up.' 

Upon overhearing this comment, the outraged teacher 
demanded to know who said it. Johnny instantly rose 
to his feet and said, 'Bill Clinton. I'll see you 
Monday.'
