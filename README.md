Too Embarrassed

Little David was in his 5th grade class when the teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living.  All the typical answers came up -- firefighter, police officer, sales rep, doctor, lawyer, etc.  David was being uncharacteristically quiet, so the teacher  asked him about his father.

'My father's an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret, and takes off all his clothes in front of other men, and they put money in his underwear. Sometimes, if the offer's really good, he'll go home with some guy and make love with him for money.'

The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly sent the other children to work on some exercises and took little David aside to ask him, 'Is that really true about your father?'

'No,' said David, 'He actually works for the 'RE-ELECT BUSH' Organization, but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids.'
