A TO Z OF MR KIASU'S PHILOSOPHY

ALWAYS must WIN.
BORROW but never RETURN.
CHEAP is GOOD.
DON'T TRUST anyone.
EVERYTHING also must GRAB.
FREE! FREE! FREE!!!
GRAB first TALK later.
HELP yourself to EVERYTHING.
i FIRST, i WANT, i EVERTHING.
JUMP queue.
KEEP coming back for MORE.
LOOK for DISCOUNTS.
MUST not lose FACE.
NEVER mind what they THINK.
OUTDO everyone you know!
PAY only when NECESSARY.
QUIT while you're ahead.
RUSHING and PUSHING wins the RACE.
SAMPLES are always WELCOME.
TAKE but don't GIVE.
UNLESS it's FREE, FORGET it.
VOW to be NUMBER ONE.
WINNERS takes it ALL! ALL!! ALL!!!
X'TRA = MORE
YELL if necessary to GET what you WANT!
ZEBRAS are KIASU before they want to be BLACK AND WHITE at the same time.

Are one of  these characters reflect us?
