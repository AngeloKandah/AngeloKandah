Bill TITLE Hillary..

Bill JOKE Hillary Clinton were sleeping at the White House. Hillary wakes up and starts shaking Bill to wake him up. 'Bill, Bill wake up.' 

Bill continues sleeping. Hillary shouts, 'Bill, Bill wake up.' 

Bill finally wakes up and says, 'What do you want?' Hillary responds, 'I have to go use the bathroom.' 

Bill says, 'Please tell me you didn't wake me up just to tell me you have to go to the bathroom.' 

Hillary says, 'No, I just wanted to tell you to save my spot.'
