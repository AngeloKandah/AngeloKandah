The Butcher

A butcher was minding his store one day, when a dog ran in and stole a cut of meat off his counter. The butcher recognized the dog as belonging to his neighbor, who was a lawyer. He called up his neighbor and said, 'Your dog stole meat from my store. I believe you owe me for the meat.' The lawyer said, ' You are correct. How much was the meat?' The butcher told him that it cost $4.50, the lawyer replied that he should receive a check for that amount in the mail the next day. The next day, the check arrived in the mail for $4.50, with a bill attached for $150, 'for legal consultation'.
