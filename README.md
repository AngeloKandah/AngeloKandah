Calming Your Son

In the supermarket was a man pushing a cart which contained a screaming, bellowing baby. The gentleman kept repeating softly, 'Don't get excited, Albert; don't scream, Albert; don't yell, Albert; keep calm, Albert.' 

A woman standing next to him said, 'You certainly are to be commended for trying to soothe your son, Albert.' 

The man looked at her and said, 'Lady, I'm Albert.'
