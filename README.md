You've turned into a Mom When.....

You Know You've Turned Into a Mom When...
You automatically double-knot everything you tie. 

You find yourself humming the Barney song as you do the dishes. 

You hear a baby cry in the grocery store, and you start to gently sway back and forth, back and forth. However, your children are at school! 

You actually start to like the smell of strained carrots mixed with applesauce. 

You weep through the scene in Dumbo when his mom is taken away, not to mention what Bambi does to you. 

You get soooo into crafts you contemplate writing a book called 101 Fun Crafts to do with Dryer Lint and Eggshells. 

You spend a half hour searching for your sunglasses only to have your teenager say, 'Mom, why don't you wear the ones you pushed up on your head?' 

You are out for a nice romantic meal with your husband, enjoying some real adult conversation, when suddenly you realize that you've reached over and started to cut up his steak!
