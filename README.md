In And Out of Puddles

Five toads arrived at the Heaven's Gates. The man in charge asked for each toad's name and what they had been doing. 

The first gave his name and said he had been going in and out of puddles. The man let him through the gate. 

He interrogated the next three toads and all three too said they had been going in and out of puddles. Since there was nothing wrong, the man let them all in.

Then he reached the last toad. She was a pretty one, in toad's sense, and when asked what her name was, she replied, 'Puddles.'
