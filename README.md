Need More Excercise

A 75-year-old woman went to the doctor for a check up. The doctor told her she needed more cardiovascular activity, and recommended that she engage in sexual activity three times a week. A bit embarrassed, she said to the doctor, 'Please tell my
husband.'

The doctor went out into the waiting room and told the husband that his wife needed sex three times a week. The 80-year-old husband replied, 'Which days?'

The doctor answered, 'Monday, Wednesday, and Friday would be ideal.

The husband said, 'I can bring her on Monday and Wednesday, but on Fridays, she'll have to take the bus.'
