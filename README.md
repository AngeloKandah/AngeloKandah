Real Men

As I always say, 'REAL men don't shave below the neck.'

Well, unless they are a body builder, I guess you have to show it off.

Then again, it might be good for a boxer to be more slippery so punches have less 'stick' or whatever.

Yea, I guess it's the same with kick boxers.

Also, I guess porn stars have their reasons.

And male models....

OK, I guess I meant that 'REAL men don't shave below the neck, unless they can beat me up, of course.'
