Ice Cream

A mother found her son scooping ice cream in the kitchen and she was mad.

Mom : 'Dinner is going to be ready in an hour, put that ice cream away and go play.'

Son : 'But mom, there's no one to play with.'

Mom : 'I'll play with you, what do you wanna play?'

Son : 'Lets play mommy and daddy, you go upstairs and lay down on the bed.'

The mom said 'ok', and went upstairs. The son put on his dad's fishing hat and lit up one of his dad's cigarettes. He went upstairs and opened the door.

Mom : 'Now what do I do?'

Son : 'Get your ass out of bed, you whore, and fix that kid some friggin ice cream.'
