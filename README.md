Do you know the muffin man, the muffin man, the muffin man?
Do you know the muffin man who lives on Dreary lane?

I just shot the muffin man, the mufifn man, the muffin man.
I just shot the muffin man who lives on Dreary Lane.

I shot him with a 20 gauge, a 20 gauge, a 20 gauge
I shot him with a 20 gauge, and now he's dead.
