Roulette

The beautiful, vain blonde was visiting Las Vegas for the first time.  She approached the roulette wheel, but it looked very confusing.

'How should I bet?' she asked the man standing beside her.

'Try betting your age,' he suggested.

So the blonde put $500 on the number 32.  The ball landed on 36, and the blonde promptly fainted.
