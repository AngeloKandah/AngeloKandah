Heart Attack

Because an increasing number of people are having heart attacks while gambling, the big, high-class casinos are now equipped with sophisticated defibrillators. They are computer-controlled to deliver the exact electric shock needed to revive a heart attack victim. That is, if you're at a big, high-class casino. 

At the cheaper casinos downtown, they just drag you across the carpet and touch your finger to the doorknob.
