Will you remarry if I die?

WIFE: 'What would you do if I died? Would you get married again?' 
HUSBAND: 'Definitely not!' 
WIFE: 'Why not - don't you like being married?' 
HUSBAND: 'Of course I do.' 
WIFE: 'Then why wouldn't you remarry?' 
HUSBAND: 'Okay, I'd get married again.' 
WIFE: 'You would? (with a hurtful look on her face).' 
HUSBAND: (makes audible groan). 
WIFE: 'Would you sleep with her in our bed?' 
HUSBAND: 'Where else would we sleep?' 
WIFE: 'Would you replace my pictures with hers?' 
HUSBAND: 'That would seem like the proper thing to do.' 
WIFE: 'Would she use my golf clubs?' 
HUSBAND: 'No, she's left-handed.'
