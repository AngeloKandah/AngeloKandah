What are Editors and How Do I Become One?

An editor is someone who has earned enough points to 'unlock' certain features of the website. Editors have certain degrees of ability to modify the jokes on this website. Here is a list of the requirements and privileges given to those who meet the requirements. You do not need to ask to become an editor. If you meet the requirements you automatically have those privileges.(Note: You may not get those privileges if you exhibit bad behavior toward the website.)

Level 0: (100 Points) You can report and verify duplicate jokes.

Level 1: (500 Points) You can suggest and verify corrections to jokes in order to improve spelling, grammar and other errors.

Level 2: (1000 Points) Your votes on jokes count as double (but you still only get 1 point for a vote)

Level 3: (4000 Points) Your votes on jokes count as triple (but you still only get 1 point for a vote)
