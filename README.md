Fun Things To Do In A Waiting Room

Fun things to do in a Waiting Room-
----------------------------------------------------

1.) Stand in a doorway and press your arms against the frame.

2.) Take a pencil or pen and make little airplane noises and if anyone notices, stare at them and say, 'We've been spotted!' and run around in circles.

3.) Try to get behind the receptionist's counter and when some one comes, pop up, and yell 'surprise!' at anyone under 50. (heart attack risk)

4.) Make paper airplanes out of magazine pages. Fly them around the room.

5.) Stare at someone in the room and yell, 'It's an agent!' and run out.

6.) Come in dressed as a bum and ask if they have any fried beans.

7.) Repeat the following conversation ten times to the same random person in the room:
 
You: 'Do you hear that?'
Person: 'What?'
You: 'Never mind, it's gone now.'

8.) Come in dressed in army fatigues.

9.) Leave your zipper open and if anyone asks say: 'Sorry, I really prefer it this way.'

10.) Babble incoherently at the receptionist and ask, 'Did you get all that? I don't want to repeat it.'

11.) Tuck one pant leg into your sock and if asked, reply 'Not now' and walk away.

12.) Take your shoes off and ask some one 'You wanna trade?'

13.) Stare blankly at some one and if they start to look uncomfortable, say 'I'm onto you...' and squint.

14.) Bang your head against the wall or corner in the room and mutter, 'shut up, all of you, just shut up!' even if there is no one there other than the receptionist.
