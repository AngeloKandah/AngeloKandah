Bull Auction

A couple go to an agricultural show way out in the countryside a fine Sunday afternoon, and are watching the auctioning off of reproduction bulls.  

The guy selling the bulls announces the first bull to be auctioned off: 'A fine specimen, this bull reproduced 60 times last year.'  

The wife nudges her husband in the ribs, and comments: 'See! That was more than 5 times a month!'

The second bull is to be sold: 'Another fine specimen, this wonder reproduced 120 times last year.'

Again the wife bugs her husband: 'Hey, that's some 10 times a month. What do YOU say to that?!' Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison.

The third bull is up for sale: 'And this extraordinary specimen reproduced 360 times last year!'

The wife slaps her husband on the arm and yells: 'That's once a day, every day of the year!  How about YOU?!'

The husband was pretty irritated by now, and yells back: 'Sure, once a day! But ask the announcer if they were all with the same cow!'
