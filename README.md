5 You're So Poor Insults

1) You're so poor that when somebody rings the doorbell you have to stick your head out the window and yell, 'Ding-Dong!'

2) You're so poor that when I asked if I could use the bathroom at your house your mom gave me two sticks, one to hold the ceiling up and one to fight the cockroaches.

3) You're so poor that your house is 5 square yards, one floor and no walls.

4) You're so poor that your house is very dark because you can't afford a light bulb.

5) You're so poor that you live in an out-house.
