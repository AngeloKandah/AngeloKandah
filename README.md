Another 'You Know You're a Pothead If...'

1) Your life's ambition involved 2 things. 'get high' and 'earn just enough money to get high'

2) You're nervous around the police even if you have nothing on you because 'you just know they know,'

-or-

You WANT them to search you because you don't have anything just so you can laugh at them.

3) You set aside actual lump sums of money to buy weed and treat it like your 'utility bill.'

4) You were never out of weed until your friends were out of weed.

5) Every time you happened to catch the clock at a glance and see '4:20', you automatically think of weed. (Whether you still smoke or have quit before)

7) You would drive over 100 miles if you knew a guy who was selling weed 20 bucks cheaper then the guy next door.

8) You've actually 'worked' for weed.

9) You've actually held up a sign that said 'will work for weed'

10) You're high reading this and didn't know there is no #6.






11) You want to argue with me because # 2 is a two part answer, and bring in the philosophy behind it.
