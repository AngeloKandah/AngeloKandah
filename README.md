Cowboy Boots

A handsome mid-age couple, John and Gail,  like living in Texas. Even though they have lived in Texas most of their married life John never
had a pair of authentic cowboy boots. Seeing some on sale at Sheplers one day, he buys them, wears them home, walking proudly. He walks into the house and says to his wife: 'Notice anything different about me?'
 
Gail looks him over, 'Nope.'
 
Frustrated John storms off in to the bathroom, undresses, and walks back into the room completely naked except for the boots. Again, he asks, a little louder this time, 'Notice anything DIFFERENT NOW?'
Gail looks up and says, 'John, what's different? It's hanging down today it was hanging down yesterday, it'll be hanging down again
tomorrow.
 
Furious, John yells, 'AND DO YOU KNOW WHY IT IS HANGING DOWN, GAIL? IT'S HANGING DOWN BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT MY NEW BOOTS!!!!!'
 
To which Gail replies, 'Shoulda bought a hat, John. Shoulda bought a hat.'
