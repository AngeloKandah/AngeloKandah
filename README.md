Anything You Can Do

An F-111 was flying escort with a B-52 and generally making a nuisance of himself by flying rolls around the lumbering old bomber. 

The message for the B-52 crew was, 'Anything you can do, I can do better.'

Not to be outdone, the bomber pilot announced that he would rise to the challenge. The B-52, however, continued its flight, straight and level.

Perplexed, the fighter pilot asked, 'I'm waiting, what are you going to do?' 

'We just shut down two engines.'
