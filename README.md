The Perfect Husband

There are several men in the locker room of a private club after exercising. Suddenly a cell phone that was on one of the benches rings. A man picks it up and the following conversation ensues: 
       
'Hello?' 
'Honey, It's me.' 
'Sugar!' 
'Are you at the club?' 
'Yes.' 

'Great! I am at the mall 2 blocks from where you are. I saw a beautiful mink coat... It is absolutely gorgeous!! Can I buy it?' 
       
'What's the price?' 
       
'Only $1,500.00' 
       
'Well, OK, go ahead and get, if you like it that much...' 
       
'Ahhh and I also stopped by the Mercedes dealership and saw the 2001 models. I saw one I really liked. I spoke with the salesman and he gave me a really good price ... and since we need to exchange the BMW that we bought last year...' 
       
'What price did he quote you?' 
'Only $60,000...' 
'OK, but for that price I want it with all the options.' 
'Great!, before we hang up, something else...' 
'What?' 
       
'It might look like a lot, but I was reconciling your bank account and...I stopped by the real estate agent this morning and I saw the house we had looked at last year ... it's on sale!! Remember? The one with a pool, English Garden, acre of park area, beachfront property...' 

'How much are they asking?' 
       
'Only $450,000... a magnificent price, and I see that we have that much in the bank to cover...' 'Well, then go ahead and buy it, but just bid $420,000. OK?' 
       
'OK, sweetie... Thanks! I'll see you later!! I love you!!!' 
       
'Bye... I do too...' 
       
The man hangs up, closes the phone's flap and raises his hand while holding the phone and asks to all those present: 'Does anyone know who this phone belongs to?'
