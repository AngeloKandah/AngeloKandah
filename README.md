Breakfast With Chris

This is from a script for an upcoming animated series I'm working on. Keep in mind that Chris is 19 years-old.

Setting-Turner household
Characters-Chris, Johnathan, and Evan (wearing maids uniform)
(Chris walks into the living room with his backpack on. Johnathan is eating breakfast, and Evan is mopping the kitchen floor.)
Johnathan: Hey Chris are you ready for school?
Chris: I sure am Johnathan. 
Evan: Hey Chris
Chris: Hey Evan
Johnathan: Come on eat some breakfast. I made you pancakes.
Chris: I want eggs.
Johnathan: You don't like eggs.
Chris: Yeah I do.
Johnathan: No, you say you like eggs. But then when I give them to you, you throw a fit and say they're nasty.
Chris: I promise I won't.
Johnathan: Alright fine then. (Puts eggs on Chris' plate)
Chris: (Smacks the plate off-screen)
Evan: (Off-Screen) Oh my god aaaah! There's pepper in my eye!
Johnathan: What the hell!? 
Chris: You forgot the cheese.
Johnathan: Yeah well you're not getting anymore breakfast.
Chris: But I'm hungry.
Johnathan: Fine, but I'm giving you pancakes. (Puts pancakes on Chris' plate)
Chris: Thank you. (Smacks plate off-screen)
Evan: (Off-screen) Ah, Dammit! There's syrup in my wounds!
Johnathan: What was that for!?
Chris: I wanted the Mickey Mouse pancakes.
Johnathan: (Facepalm)
