The Best Friends

Two best friends were staying at a hotel.Their room was on the tenth floor. One day, because the lift was under repair, they started climbing the stairs. On reaching the first floor, one friend remembered something and said -
 
First Friend : Hey listen! I want to tell you something.

Second Friend : Go on, speak.

First friend : No, no, you may get angry. I'll tell you later.

This conversation happened whenever they reached a floor.

Finally,when they reached in front of their room -

First Friend : Hey listen! I want to tell you something.

Second Friend (irritated) : Please speak then.

First Friend : Friend,we forgot to collect the keys from the desk.
