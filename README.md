At the Movies

John took Mary to the movies, and they both enjoyed the show very much.
Afterwards, John asked Mary what she wanted to do; 'I want to get weighed,' she said.
He took her to a drugstore, where the machine said she weighed 107 pounds, but for the rest of the night she pouted and sulked.
When they finally got to her house, John tried to kiss her, but she said, 'Go on home now, I've had a wowsy time.'
