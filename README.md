Holy . . . !

Four Catholic men and a Catholic woman were having coffee.

The first Catholic man tells his friends, 'My son is a priest, when he walks into a room, everyone calls him 'Father'.'

The second Catholic man chirps, 'My son is a Bishop. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Grace'.'

The third Catholic gent says, 'My son is a Cardinal . . . When he enters a room everyone says 'Your Eminence'.'

The fourth Catholic man then says, 'My son is the Pope. When he walks into a room people call him 'Your Holiness'.'

Since the lone Catholic woman was sipping her coffee in silence, the four men give her a subtle, 'Well . . .?'

She proudly replies, 'I have a daughter, slim, tall, 38D breast, 24' waist and 34' hips. When she walks into a room, people say, 'Oh My God.''
