Test Grades

A young brunette used to always wonder why her blonde best friend would get A's on all her tests and the brunette would get A-'s.
She thought that was a little weird, so one day she asked her friend why she got better grades, and her friend said that she just copied the answers out of her book, so the brunette said, 'But none of them were open book,' and the blonde says, 'Oh, that might explain why no one was using their books!'
