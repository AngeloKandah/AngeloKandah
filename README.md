How to Spell...

A famous blonde actress and her husband are going to meet an American. However, her husband has forgotten the young man's name. Later, the young man asks for an autograph. She asks, trying to find his name out, 'How do you spell your name?' Upon hearing this, he said,'B-E-N A long time ago when I saw your first play on Broadway and got an autograph, you knew how to spell it.'
