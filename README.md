Take with Water

After giving a woman a full medical examination, the doctor explained his prescription as he wrote it out. 'When you get up, take the green pill with a glass of water.  Take the blue pill with a glass of water after lunch.  Then just before going to bed, take the red pill with another glass of water.'

'Exactly what is my problem, Doctor?' the woman asked.

'You're not drinking enough water.'
