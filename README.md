I Do Again?

A senior citizen said to his eighty-year old buddy, 'So I hear you're getting married?'
'Yep!'

'Do I know her?'
'Nope!'

'This woman, is she good looking?'
'Not really.'

'Is she a good cook?'
'Naw, she can't cook too well.'

'Does she have lots of money?'
'Nope! Poor as a church mouse.'

'Well, then, is she good in bed?'
'I don't know.'

'Why in the world do you want to marry her then?'
'Because she can still drive!'
