Jewelry

At a jewelry store, a young man bought an expensive locket as a present for his girlfriend. 'Don't you want her name engraved upon it?' asked the jeweler. The young man thought for a moment, and then, ever the pragmatic, steadfastly replied,

'No, just engrave it: To My One And Only Love. That way, if we break up and she throws it back to me in anger, I can use it again.'
