Dream

Jack tells his shrink, 'Last night I dreamed you were my mother.'

'How did you feel about it after you woke up?' asks the psychiatrist.

'I overslept,' answers Jack. 'Then I remembered I had an appointment with you, so I grabbed a Coke and some cookies for breakfast and came right over.  I didn't really have time to think about it.  What does it mean, doc?'

'A Coke and some cookies?' says the psychiatrist.  'You call that breakfast?'
