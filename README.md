Kids View on School

A little girl had just finished her first week of school. 'I'm wasting my time,' she said to her mother.

'I can't read, I can't write - and they won't let me talk!' 
--------------------
On the way home from the first day of school, the father asked his son, 'What did you do at school today?' 

The little boy shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Nothing'. 

Hoping to draw his son into conversation, the father persisted and said, 'Well, did you learn about any numbers, study certain letters, or maybe a particular color?' 

The perplexed child looked at his father and said, 'Daddy, didn't you go to school when you were a little boy?'
