Magical Lamp

Once upon a time, there was a man holding a magical lamp, he went to a bar where he then got a drink. The bartender sees him and asks him to chat, the man says,'I have a magical lamp rite here!' 

The bartender says,' Wow, does this mean I can wish for a million bucks.'

The man goes, 'Yes!'

Bartender goes:' I wish for a million bucks!'

POOF!

The air is filled with 1 million ducks. 

The bartender outraged says,' Hey you cheated me!'

The man goes, 'Hey it ain't that easy!'

*Sorry, Did my best
