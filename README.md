Stuffed Lion

A hunter visited another hunter and was given a tour of his home. In the den was a stuffed lion. 

The visiting hunter asked, 'When did you bag him?' 
The host said, 'That was three years ago, when I went hunting with my wife.' 
'What's he stuffed with?' asked the visiting hunter, and the host said, 'My wife.'
