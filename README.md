Bangety Bang Bang

Seems there was a young soldier, who, just before battle, told his sergeant that he didn't have a rifle. 

'That's no problem, son,' said the sergeant. 'Here, take this broom. Just point it at the Germans, and go 'Bangety Bang Bang'.' 

'But what about a bayonet, Sarge?' asked the young (and gullible) recruit. 

The sergeant pulls a piece of straw from the end of the broom, and attaches it to the handle end. 'Here, use this... just go, 'Stabity Stab Stab'.' 

The recruit ends up alone on the battlefield, holding just his broom. Suddenly, a German soldier charges at him. The recruit points the broom, 'Bangety Bang Bang!' The German falls dead. 

More Germans appear. The recruit, amazed at his good luck, goes 'Bangety Bang Bang! Stabity Stab Stab!' He mows down the enemy by the dozens. Finally, the battlefield is clear, except for one German soldier walking slowly toward him. 

'Bangety Bang Bang! shouts the recruit. The German keeps coming. 'Bangety Bang Bang!' repeats the recruit, to no avail. He gets desperate. 'Bangety Bang Bang! Stabity Stab Stab!' It's no use. 

The German keeps coming. He stomps the recruit into the ground, and says, 'Tankety Tank Tank.'
