Concerning the Omnipresent Lenin Propaganda

A schoolteacher is leading her students through a park, and they see a baby hare. These are city kids, and have never seen a hare. 'Do you know who this is?' asks the teacher. No one knows. 'Come on kids', says the teacher trying to lead the children to the answer, 'He's a character in many stories, songs and poems we always read.' One student 'figures it out,' pats the hare and says reverently, 'So *that's* what you're like, Grandpa Lenin!'
