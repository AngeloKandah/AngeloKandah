Natural

A brunette, a red-head, and a blonde with a green stripe in her hair, walked into a barbor shop.  The barbor asks where the brunette got the haircolor.  She replies 'Natural.'  He asks the red-head the same.  She says, 'Natural.'  Then he asks the blonde the same question, and she rubs the back of her hand over her nose, and on the green stripe, and says 'Natural.'
