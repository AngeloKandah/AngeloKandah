Jonah's Fate

A little girl spoke to her teacher about whales. 

The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human because even though it is a very large mammal, its throat is very small. 

The little girl said, 'But how can that be? Jonah was swallowed by a whale.' 

Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human. 'It is physically impossible!' she said. 

Undaunted, the little girl said, 'Well, when I get to heaven I will ask Jonah.' 

To this, the teacher said, 'What if Jonah went to hell?' 

The little girl replied, 'Then YOU ask him!'
