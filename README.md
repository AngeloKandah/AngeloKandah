New Bowling Rules

Supplemental Rules for Bowling 

If you holler 'overs!' before the ball passes the arrows, you get to throw the ball over, unless of course, you get a strike. In which case, you can renege on the 'overs'. 

When your team is about 10 marks down in the 8th or 9th frame, you can invoke the rule 'First Team Through Bowling Wins the Game', and your team still has a chance. 

After a member of the opposing team bowls 4 strikes in a row, he/she must bowl the next 4 frames blindfolded. If he/she continues to strike, his/her shoelaces will be tied together for 2 frames. 

When you leave the 10-pin and you know you can't make the spare, but another member of your team can, invoke the 'Designated Bowler' rule. 

After you have 4 splits in one game, you may say 'Kings X' and take those 4 frames over. However, if you split on the 2nd time around, you accept it. After all, 'Fair is Fair'. 

If your ball goes in the gutter and jumps back onto the lane, knocking dow pins, by golly, you get them! That's much harder than to knock them down the conventional way. Good bowling should be recognized. 

A ball should be declared dead when you bowl 3 games without a strike. It shall be the owners privilege to decide on the disposition of said dead ball - Burial at Sea, Dropped from an airplane over a live volcano, or a simple burial in the city dump. For a small fee, a league officer can be bribed to deliver a short eulogy.
