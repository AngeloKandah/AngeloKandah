Ice Fishing

One day I asked my grandfather how to ice fish. He said all you need is a can of peas and a club.

'Huh?', I said. 'How does that work?'

'Well,' he said, 'After you cut the hole in the ice you just place the peas around the edge of the hole! Then you wait by the hole with your club.'

'What does that do?' I asked.

'Well,' he said with a grin. 'When the fish come up to take a pee, you hit him over the head with the club!'
