Wife Goes on a Trip.........

A woman goes to Italy to attend a two week, company training session. Her husband drives her to the airport and wishes her a good trip.

The wife answers, 'Thank you hon, what would like me to bring for you?'

The husband laughs and says, 'An Italian girl.'

The woman kept quiet and left.

Two weeks later he picks her up at the airport and asks, 'So, hon, how was the trip?'

'Very good, thank you.'

'And what happened to my present?'

'What present?' she asked

'The one I asked for - an Italian girl!'

'Oh, that,' she said.

'Well, I did what I could, now we'll have to wait for nine months to see if it's a girl!'
