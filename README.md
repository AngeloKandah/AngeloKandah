Old Standards

Recently a family court judge was interviewing a 15 yr. old boy, asking him which parent he wanted to live with, his mother or father?  The kid said he didn't want to live with either one -- that both of them beat him all the time.  The kid said he wanted to live with the Dallas Cowboys -- they never beat anybody!
