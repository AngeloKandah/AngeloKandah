Plastic Surgery

A blonde went to her regular plastic surgion one day. When she walked in, he said to her, 'What more can I do for you? I have changed your every part of your body that you could think of! I even did your ears!' 

She replied, 'Well, this is kind of embarrasing for me say out loud.' 

The plastic surgion, curious to know what the blonde wanted done, asked, 'What is it? You can trust me. 

She answered shyly. 'This morning, while I was looking in the mirror, I noticed that my butt had a huge crack down the middle and i was wondering if you could get me a new one that isn't broken.'
