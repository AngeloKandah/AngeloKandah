Same Condition

One day, a customer walked into a pet shop and told the clerk, 'I need two small, gray mice and about five dozen roaches.' Puzzled, the shop attendant asked the reason for this strange request.

'Well, I'm moving out of my apartment and my lease told me that I must leave the premises in exactly the same condition I found them.'
