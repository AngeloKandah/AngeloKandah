Sobbing Jerry

Six-year-old Jerry came downstairs bellowing lustily. 'What's the matter?' asked his mother. 'Papa was hanging pictures, and he just
hit his thumb with a hammer,' said Jerry. 'That's not so serious,' soothed his mother. 'A big man like you shouldn't cry at a trifle like that. Why didn't you just laugh?' 'I did,' sobbed Jerry.
