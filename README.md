My Number?

A co-worker of mine fielded phone calls from his Alumni Association every three months for about five years, ostensibly checking to see that his records were up to date, and coincidentally asking if he'd like to donate to the Alumni Association. Once, when checking his records, the employee asked, 'Is xxx-xxxx your current phone number?'

Seeing his opportunity, he answered no, and made up a new phone number. He hasn't heard from them since.
