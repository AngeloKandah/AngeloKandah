Scaredy-Cat

Two kids are arguing over whose father is the biggest scaredy-cat.

The first kid said, 'My dad is so scared that, when lightning strikes, he hides underneath the bed.'

'Oh, yeah? That's nothing,' said the second kid. 'My dad is so scared that, when my mom has to work the night shift, he goes next door to sleep with Mrs. Jones!'
