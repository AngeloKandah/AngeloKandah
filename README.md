Blonde Football

A guy took his blonde girlfriend to a football game
for the first time.
After the game he asked his girlfriend how she liked
the game. 'Oh, I really liked it,' she said, 'but I
just couldn't understand why they were killing each
other for 25 cents.'
What on earth do you mean???'
Well, I saw them flip a coin and one team got it and
then for the rest of the game all they kept screaming
was: 'Get the quarter back! Get the quarter back!'
