Three Politicians

Three senators were sitting at the bar and having drinks with each other. The democrat started a conversation of were they liked their wives to be positioned during sex, the democrat said that he likes his wife on top, so he can see all of her. The republican said, 'No no no I like my wife on the bottom, she needs to know who the one with the control and dominance is.' The independent blurted out, 'I prefer my wife out of town.'
