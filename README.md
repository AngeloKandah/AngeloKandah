Accidents

The cowboy was trying to buy a health insurance policy. The insurance agent was going down the list of standard questions. 

'Ever have an accident?' 

'Nope, nary a one.' 

'None? You've never had any accidents.' 

'Nope. Ain't never had one. Never.' 

'Well, you said on this form you were bit by a snake once. Wouldn't you consider that an accident?' 

'Heck, no. That dang varmint bit me on purpose.'
