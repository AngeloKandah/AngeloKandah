Jesus is Everywhere

A Little boy was afraid of the dark. One night his mother told him to go out to the back porch and bring her the broom. The little boy turned to his mother and said, 'Mama, I don't want to go out there. It's dark.' The mother smiled reassuringly at her son. 'You don't have to be afraid of the dark,' she explained. 'Jesus is out there. He'll look after you and protect you.' 

The little boy looked at his mother real hard and asked, 'Are you sure he's out there?' 'Yes, I'm sure. He is everywhere, and he is always ready to help you when you need him,' she said. 

The little boy thought about that for a minute and then went to the back door and cracked it a little. Peering out into the darkness, he called 'Jesus? If you're out there, would you please hand me the broom?
