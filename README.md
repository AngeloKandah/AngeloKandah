Ole and Lars

Ole and Lars were on their very first train ride. They had brought along bananas for lunch. Just as they began to peel them, the train entered a long, dark tunnel. 

'Have you eaten your banana yet?' Ole asked excitedly 

'No,' replied Lars. 

'Vell, don't touch it den,' Ole exclaimed. 'I yust took vun bite and vent blind!'
