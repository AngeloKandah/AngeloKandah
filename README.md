Cliff Diving

A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead were all about to jump off a cliff. As they jumped, they would yell the name of what they wanted to turn into.

The redhead went first. She yelled, 'Hawk!' and she turned into a hawk and flew away.

The brunette went next. She yelled, 'Butterfly!' and she turned into a butterfly and flew away.

The blonde went last. As she was about to jump, she tripped, and yelled, 'Crap!' As she fell, she turned into a piece of poop.
