What's the Charge?

A young man worked at an aquarium feading the animals, cleaning the tanks and the like.  One day his boss came to him and said, 'We have a group of second-graders coming for a field trip in about thirty minutes and the dolphins are getting 'playful'.  The only thing that will make the dolphins behave is baby seagull meat.  I want you to take this bag and go down to the beach and get some baby seagulls, but be careful because a lion has escaped from the zoo.  They say it's been shot with a tranq gun so it shouldn't be a problem.'

So, the young man took the bag, made his way down to the beach and got the seagulls with no problem.  He decided to take the short cut through the woods on his way back.  Suddenly, as he rounded a bend in the path, he saw the escaped lion laying across the path ahead of him, apparently sleeping.  

The bushes were rather thick at this point, so he had only two choices: go past the lion or back the way he came.  He decided he didn't have enough time to go back.  He got up his nerve and very,very carefully stepped over the lion.  He did so without waking it and was breathing a sigh of relief when a police officer stepped out of the woods and told him he was under arrest.

'But, Officer, what's the charge?' he queried.

'Transporting young gulls across a sedate lion.' (Transporting youing girls across state lines)
