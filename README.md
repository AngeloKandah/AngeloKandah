Monkey Eyes

There was a fatal bus accident and the only survivor was a monkey.  In order to fill in the blanks of the event, the police had hired a monkey trainer that could speak sign language with the monkey.

The trainer first asked the monkey if he had actually been on the bus.  The monkey nodded yes.  

The trainer then asked the monkey what was going on in the bus just before the accident.  The monkey made hand motions to signal that there had been some heavy drinking of alcohol going on.  

The trainer motioned, 'I see, what else was going on?'  To this, the monkey made gestures to show people smoking marijuana.

The trainer motioned, 'Isee, what else was going on?'  To this, the monkey depicted with his hands that everyone was having sex.

The trainer, conviced of what actually happened, then asked the monkey, 'What were you doing  while all this was going on?'

The monkey replied, 'looking over my shoulder while I was driving the bus!'
