How Much Ribbon

My brother, Julian, is a little simple. I recently asked him to buy me some ribbon for my daughter's pretty pink bonnet. He went to the haberdashery shop for the required length but accidentally interchanged the feet and inches. When I measured the resulting ribbon I only had 30% of the length I required. How much ribbon did I originally ask for?

I asked for 9 foot 2 inches (110 inches) and my brother brought me 2 foot 9 inches (33 inches).
