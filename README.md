Breakfast at Looooong Last (!)

Two children ordered their mother to stay in bed one Mother's Day morning. As the smell of bacon floated up from the kitchen, she lay in eager anticipation the lovely breakfast her helpful, caring children were making for her.

However, after a good long wait, she finally went downstairs to investigate. She found them both sitting at the table eating bacon and eggs.

'As a surprise for Mother's Day,' one explained, 'we decided to cook our own breakfast.'
