American, Frechman,TITLE Cinese Guy

One day the goverment desided to see how we get along with other countries so they took an american, a frechman and a chinese guy and put them on an island for a year.
   They tell the american that he is in charge of building. They tell the frenchman that he is in charge of cooking. Then, finally they tell the chinese guy that he is in charge of supplies.
   One year later the goverment comes back and the american said: 'Let me show you what I have built' and so he does. Then the frenchman said: 'Let me show you what I have cooked.' Then one of the goverment people asked what happened to the chinese guy and they said that the day that they were given their assigments he dissapeared. So they all start looking for him... Finally, the chinese guy jumps out of the woods and says: 'Supplies!!'
