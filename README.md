Going On A Date

'Emily, I don't know what to do,' Gloria said to her friend at work. 'That good-looking Alan in accounting asked me out for Saturday night. Should I go?'

'Oh, my gosh,' her friend exclaimed. 'He'll wine you, dine you, and then use any ruse to get you up to his apartment. Then he'll rip off your dress and you'll have fantastic sex!'

'What should I do?'

'Wear an old dress.'
