Irishman

Paddy was an inveterate drunkard. The parish priest ran into him one day totally inebriated, attempting to stumble home, and gave him a strong lecture against drinking.

The good father was able to convince Paddy that, 'If you continue drinking as you do, you'll gradually get smaller and smaller, and eventually you'll turn into a mouse.'

This frightened the life out of Paddy. He went home that night, and could not get that thought out of his mind. He couldn't sleep for a week worrying about the priest's threat and finally said to his wife, 'Bridget....if you should notice me getting smaller and smaller, will ye kill that blasted cat?'
