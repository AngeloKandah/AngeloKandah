Texas

It was the first day of school and this girl's teacher asked her what her name was. She said 'Texas.' The teacher said, 'Haha, no really, what's your name?' and the girl said, 'Texas,' so the teacher said, 'Go to the principal's office.'
The principal said, 'What's your name?' She replied, 'Texas.' He said, 'Funny, what's your name?' and she said, 'Texas,' so he sent her home.
As Texas was walking home, a guy stopped her and said, 'What's your name?' She said, 'Texas.' He said, 'That's funny. No, really, what's your name?' She said, 'Texas.' He said, 'I will stab you with my mother's butcher knife if you don't tell me what your real name is,' and she said, 'IT'S TEXAS!' so he stabbed her. When he got home, his mother asked, 'Where's my butcher knife?' and he sang 'DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS!'
