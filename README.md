Signs of Aging II

Signs of Aging

You just can't stand people who are intolerant.

The best part of your day is over when your alarm clock goes off.

You burn the midnight oil until 9 pm.

Your pacemaker makes the garage door go up when you watch a pretty girl go by.

The little grey haired lady you help across the street is your wife.

You have too much room in the house and not enough room in the medicine cabinet.

The gleam in your eyes is from the sun hitting your bifocals. 

Your children begin to look middle-aged. 

You've finally reached the top of the ladder only to find it's leaning against the wrong wall. 

Your mind makes contracts your body can't keep. 

You're 17 around the neck, 42 around the waist, and 96 around the golf course.
