Haunted Hotel Room

A man walked into a hotel and asked for a room. The guy behind the counter said there is only one room left but it is haunted. The man does not believe this so he gets the room. That night the man hears a voice saying 'I`m gonna find you, I`m gonna get you, I`m gonna eat you!' The man runs away scared.
The next day a father and his daughter get the room after they were warned. That night they hear 'I`m gonna find you, I`m gonna get you, I`m gonna eat you!' The girl hides under the bed as the father follows the sound to the closet. He opens the door.
There on the floor sits a little boy, picking his nose, saying 'I`m gonna find you, I`m gonna get you, I`m gonna eat you!'
