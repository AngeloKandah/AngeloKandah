Married Couple

On their way to a justice of the peace to get married, a couple had a fatal car accident. The couple found themselves sitting outside Heaven's Gate waiting on St.Peter to do an intake. While waiting, they wondered if they could possibly get married in Heaven. 

St. Peter finally showed up and they asked him. St. Peter said, 'I don't know, this is the first time anyone has asked. 'Let me go find out.' and he left. 

The couple sat and waited for an answer...for a couple of months...and they began to wonder if they really should get married in Heaven, what with the eternal aspect of it all. 'What if it doesn't work?' they wondered, 'Are we stuck together forever?' 

St. Peter returned after yet another month, looking some what bedraggled. 'Yes,' he informed the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.' 

'Great,'said the couple, 'but what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?' 

St. Peter, red-faced, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 

'What's wrong?', asked the frightened couple. 

'COME ON!' St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it will take me to find a lawyer?'
