President's Puzzle

Dick Cheney walks into the Oval Office and sees The President whooping and hollering. 
'What's the matter, Mr. President?' the Vice President inquired.

'Nothing at all, boss. I just done finished a jigsaw puzzle in record time!' the President beamed. 

'How long did it take you?' 

'Well, the box said '3 to 5 Years' but I did it in a month!'
