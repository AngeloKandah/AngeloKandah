Dust to Dust

A little boy had just got home from Sunday School and mom was cooking lunch. 'Mommy, is it true that before you're born you're just dust and after you die you go back to being dust?' 

'That's right son, why?' 

'Well that's just what they said at church today.' 

'Run up stairs and wash your hands son, lunch will be ready in a few minutes.' 

About 10 minutes went by and she called out for him to come down. 'I'll be there in a minute.' As they were about to sit down at the table, the little boy asked again about being dust before being born and after you die. 
Once again mother said yes son. 

The little boy looked at her and said, 'then you better get up to my room pretty quick, because something under my bed is either coming or going!!'
