Strange name for  Cats

One day there was a woman who lost her cat named 'LOVE.' It was pretty dark outside and she lived in New York. So, thinking that he might be down the street, she put on her house-coat and went looking for him.

When a police officer stopped to ask what she was doing, she said very honestly, 'I'm looking for LOVE.' The policeman arrested her on the spot.
