Bill Clinton and Al Gore...

Bill Clinton and Al Gore went into a local diner for lunch.  As they read the menu, the waitress came over and asked Clinton, 'Are you ready to order, sir?' 

Clinton replies, 'Yes, I'd like a quickie.' 

'A quickie?!' the waitress replies with disgust.  'Sir, given the current situation of your personal life, I don't believe that's a good idea.  I'll come back later when you are ready to make an order from the MENU.'  She walks away. 

Al Gore leans over to Clinton and says, 'Sir, it's pronounced 'Quiche''
