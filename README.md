Word Imperfect

One day, someone phoned Central Manhattan Office.

Caller: Good afternoon. I'm John Smith.
Operator: GOOD AFTERNOON! CAN I HELP YOU?
Caller: Who are you? Why are you so rude?
Operator: WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
Caller: I am looking for my sister, Gabrielle Smith. She works here, right?
Operator: SHE IS IN THE TOILET!
Caller: Okay. Now I want to know who you are. Why are you so rude?
Operator: I'M SAW LEE!
Caller: Oh, you should be sorry because you are so rude!

Then the caller hung up the phone.

*Try to pronounce 'SAW LEE'. It sounds like 'SORRY', right?
