The Final Wish

One day, Farrah Fawcett died and went to heaven. At the gates, St.Peter greeted her.

'Hello, and welcome. You have lived a life full of prosperity and love. You have given millions around the world entertainment with your acting. Now I will provide you with one wish for the Earth before you enter Heaven. What is it?'

Farrah thought for a minute, but answered, 'I would like all the children in the world to be safe.' 


The next day, Michael Jackson died.
