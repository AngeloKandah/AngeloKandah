3 blondes in the forest

There were three blondes in the forest and they saw some tracks.
The first blonde said, 'Look, bear tracks.'
The second blonde said, 'No, stupid, those are wolf tracks.'
The third blonde said, 'You're both wrong, those are rabbit tracks.'

Then the train came and ran them all over.
