A Biblical Scholar

A nice girl brings home her fiance to meet her parents.

After dinner, her mother tells her father to find out about the young man. He invites the fiance to his study for a chat.

'So, what are your plans?' the father asks the fiance.

'I am a Biblical scholar,' he replies.

'A Biblical scholar. Admirable, but what will you do to provide a nice house for my daughter to live in, as she's accustomed to?'

'I will study,' the young man replies, '...and God will provide for us.'

'And how will you buy her a beautiful engagement ring, such as she deserves?'

'I will concentrate on my studies, God will provide for us.'

'And children? How will you support children?'

'Don't worry, sir, God will provide.'

The conversation proceeds like this, and each time the father questions, the fiance insists that God will provide.

Later, the mother asks, 'So? How did it go?'

'He has no job and no plans, but the good news is he thinks I'm God.'
