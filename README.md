Thanks for being a part of my life!!! I never knew what evil was before this! 

Congratulations on your promotion. Before you go, I would like to take this knife out of my back. You'll probably need it again. 

Someday I hope to get married, but not to you. 

Sorry things didn't work out, but I can't handle guys with boobs that are bigger than mine. 

Happy Birthday! You look great for your age...Almost Lifelike!
