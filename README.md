Airport Baggage

It was my first vacation out of my home country - I was going to Australia. It was also going to be my first time on a plane, so I got a nice, large, purple bag with one of the long, pull-out handles and wheels on the bottom so you can pull it around. It was a new experience for me! But, when I got to Australia, I watched the carousel go around and I saw nothing but the long handle. I even checked the sticker, and it was from my bag. I was furious. I walked up to a woman who worked at the airport and said, 'Explain this to me!' She looked at the handle.
'Are you sure that's your bag?' she replied.
'Yes!' I cried, 'but I'm missing most of it!' 
'Well, did you leave it unattended at some point?' 
'I guess I must've!'
'Okay, now we've nicked it. Tell me what it looks like so we can get it back.' 
More angry than before, I cried, 'Well, it's got a long black handle!'

The woman wrote that down.
