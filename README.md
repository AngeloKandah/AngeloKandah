The most powerful word in the English Language

Shit may be the most powerful word in the english language:

You can be shitfaced, be shit out of luck, or have shit for brains. With a little effort you can get your shit together, find a place for your shit, or decide to shit or get off the pot.

You can smoke shit, buy shit, sell shit, lose shit, find shit, forget shit, or tell others to eat shit and die.
You can shit or go blind, have a shit fit or just shit your life away.

People can be shitheaded, shitbrained, shitblinded, and shitover. Some people know their shit, while others can't tell the difference between shit and shineola. There are lucky shits, dumb shits, crazy shits, and sweet shits. 

There is bull shit, horse shit, and chicken shit. You can throw shit, sling shit, catch shit, or duck when shit hits the fan. You can take a shit, give a shit or serve shit on a shingle. You can find yourself in deep shit, or be happier than a pig in shit. 

Some days are colder than shit, some days are hotter than shit and some Days are just shitty. Some music sounds like shit, things look like shit, and there are times when you feel like shit.

You can have too much shit, not enough shit, the right shit, the Wrong shit, or alot of weird shit.

You can carry shit, have a mountain of shit , or find yourself upshitcreek without a paddle. Sometimes everything you touch turns to shit and othertimes you swim in a lake of shit and come out smelling like a rose. Shit! When you stop to consider all the facts, it's the basic building block of creation.

And remember:once you know your shit,you don't need to know anything else.
