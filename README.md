The Job

A blonde was recently fired from her cashier job, because she kept stealing money from the register.  She went looking for work the next day.  

A few days later, she came to a man who needed someone.  'I'm here for the paint job', the blonde said eagerly.  'Alright.  Take this paint and brush, and go paint my backyard porch', replied the man.  

The blonde immediately started painting.  After she was done, she decided to do a second coat.  When she was finished, she went to the man to get her pay.  

'I finished it, and did a second coating too!  By the way, that's not a Porsche, it's a new BMW'.
