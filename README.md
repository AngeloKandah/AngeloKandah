IPhone

With iPhone, dialing contacts is a snap. Let's say you wanted to contact your ex-girlfriend to let her know how badly she's hurt you. Simply press her name, and the call is dialed. 'Dammit, Rick, stop calling me!' Then, when another call comes in, simply place that call on hold and answer the second one. 'This is Detective Hanson, from the Bay Area Police Department.' To block the call, simply press ignore. iPhone is also the best iPod ever made. With it, you can listen to the song that was playing when she said you'd be together forever. *music* Then, you can use Google maps to locate the street where she's moved away to. Simply touch the traffic button and iPhone tells you the best route to take to propose to her. Again, Apple's iPhone, a revolutionary portable device that never leaves your side. And never sleeps with your cousin.
