The Bad Priest

One day a man was walking down the road and saw the priest also walking. Since he knows the priest usually rides a bike he asks where it is. 

'Well, I woke up this morning and couldn't find it,' he replies.

'Oh. Well, here is an idea. When you go over the Ten Commandments in your sermon this morning, bear down real hard on Thou shall not steal. Then, whoever took it will feel guilty and give it back.'

'Great idea!'

Well, that afternoon the man sees the priest riding his bike. 'I see they gave it back to you. I knew my idea would work!' he says.

'Well, actually I went through the Ten Commandments like you said, but when I got to Thou shall not commit adultery, I remembered where I left my bike!'
