Bride

The Tearful Bride...

A new young blonde bride calls her mother in tears.
She sobs, 'Robert doesn't appreciate what I do for him.'

'Now, now,' her mother comforted, 'I am sure it was all just a misunderstanding.'

'No, mother,' you don't understand.
'I bought a frozen turkey roll and he yelled and screamed at me about the price!'

'Well, the nerve of that lousy cheapskate!' says her mom.
'Those turkey rolls are only a few dollars.'

'No, mother it wasn't the price of the turkey, it was the airplane ticket.'
'Airplane ticket.... What did you need an airplane ticket for?'

'Well mother, when I went to fix it, I looked at the directions on the package and it said -
'Prepare from a frozen state,' so I flew to Alaska!'
