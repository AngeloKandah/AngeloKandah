Computer Trouble

A man called the computer company because he was having trouble with his computer. A woman answered the phone.
'Hello. May I help you?
'Yes. I'm having trouble with my computer. Every time I press the enter key my computer goes biserk.'
'I think I know what you should do.'
'Really?'
'Yes.'
'What should I do?'
'You should stop pressing the enter key.'
