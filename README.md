Protestants

During the Irish Potato famine, a young Irish-Catholic woman was worried about the poverty of her family. She told her parents that she was going to America to seek her fortune. With many tears, they  let her go.

Years passed, and the woman returned home. She arrived in a private jet, dressed in a gorgeous designer gown, with dazzling, expensive jewelry. Her family was stunned by their daughter's wealth, and a more than a little curious at how she had come by it. The daughter finally confessed. 'I hate to tell you this, but the reason I became so rich was because I became a prostitute.'

Her father immediately collapsed in shock. The doctor was called, and he began to help the man. As the daughter wept at her father's bedside, she sobbed, 'I didn't realize he would be so disappointed to hear I became a prostitute!'

The father sat bolt upright. 'Prostitute?!' he exclaimed. 'I thought you said 'Protestant'!'
