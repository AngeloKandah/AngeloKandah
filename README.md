The Ghost

Oscar got to the broken down inn and asked for a room.

'I have only one room left,' said the innkeeper, 'But before I give it to you, I must tell you that room is where the white-eyed ghost lives.'
Oscar wasn't worried. 'I'll take the room,' he said, 'I'm not afraid of ghosts.'

That night, when Oscar went to bed, a scary voice said, 'Boooo! I am the white-eyed ghost....'
'Shut up!' Oscar said, 'i'm tired!'

'Boooooo' the ghost said again, 'I am the white-eyed ghost!'

Oscar sat up, reached over, picked up a chair and threw it at the ghost, who disappeared. Oscar lay down again and shut his eyes.

'Boooooo!' moaned the voice from the darkness, 'I am the black-eyed ghost....'
