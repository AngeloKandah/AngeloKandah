At The Crucifixion

In 'The Greatest Story Ever Told', John Wayne played a centurion at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

One of his lines was, 'Truly he is the Son of God!'

The director felt John W. wasn't putting enough into it, and asked him to deliver the line again, but with a little more emphasis - 'to put some awe into it'.

'OK,' says John, 'Awww - truly he is the Son of God!'
