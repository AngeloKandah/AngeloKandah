Sven and Ole

Sven and Ole are visiting a relative in Texas. While walking along the street, they see a sign on a store front which reads:

Suits $5.00 each
Shirts $2.00 each
Trousers $2.50 per pair

Sven says to his pal, 'Hey Ole! We could buy a whole lot of dem and ven ve get back to Minnesota, ve could sell them and make a fortune.'

'Now ven ve go into the shop, yust let me do all da talkin' cause if dey hear your Minnesota accent dey might tink ve are dumb Norwegians and try ta raise da price - but I can speak with a perfect Texas drawl.'

They go in, and Sven drawls out an order of 50 suits at $5.00 each, 100 shirts at $2.00 each and 50 pair of trousers at $2.50 each.

The owner of the shop says 'You're Norwegians from Minnesota, aren't you?'

'Uff da!' says a surprised Sven. 'How'd you know dat?'

The owner says, 'Because this is a dry-cleaners.'
