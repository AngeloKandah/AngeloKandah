The Johnsons

Two guys are sitting in a bar. The one says to the other, 'Are you going to the Johnsons' tonight?'
The other says, 'Dunno, I don't feel like it, but my wife wants to.'

'Yeah, me too, I don't feel like it, but my wife insists.'

Both of them sigh deeply, look at each other and say:
'All right then. See you at the Johnsons'!'
