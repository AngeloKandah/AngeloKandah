Proverbs

A first grade teacher collected well-known proverbs. She gave each kid in the class the first half of the proverb, and asked them to fill in the rest. Here's what the kids came up with: 

Better to be safe than... punch a 5th grader. 
Strike while the... bug is close. 
It's always darkest before... daylight savings time. 
Never underestimate the power of... termites. 
You can lead a horse to water but... how? 
Don't bite the hand that... looks dirty. 
No news is... impossible. 
A miss is as good as a... Mr. 
You can't teach an old dog... math. 
If you lie down with dogs, you... will stink in the morning. 
Love all, trust... me. 
The pen is mightier than... the pigs. 
An idle mind is... the best way to relax. 
Where there is smoke, there's... pollution. 
Happy is the bride who... gets all the presents. 
A penny saved is... not much. 
Two is company, three's... The Musketeers. 
None are so blind as... Helen Keller.

Laugh and the whole world laughs with you. Cry and... you have to blow your nose.
