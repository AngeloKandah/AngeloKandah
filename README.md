Beware Of What You Say

A computer teacher who doesn't speak good english tells his student 'Paul open the window let the Air Force Come.'

At another time the same teacher and his wife sees one of his students in mall. The next day the teacher says to the student 'Tim, yesterday I saw you with my wife at the mall.'
