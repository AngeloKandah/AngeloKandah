Motorized Wheelchairs

I  was looking at this parked, motorized wheelchair once, and I noticed that it had a dial on it to control it's speed.  At one end there was a turtle, and at the other end there was a rabbit.  I just assumed at first that the turtle was representing the slower speed, and that the rabbit was for the faster speed, but then I remembered who won when those two animals raced.
I think that it would be cool if cars used this same system too.  You know, you get pulled over by a police officer and he says to you 'Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you were speeding?  We had you clocked  on our radar at going 'Rabbit' and I'm sure that you know the posted speed limit here is only 'Raccoon'.  Now we'll just let you off with a warning this time since you were only going a 'hare' over the speed limit.'
