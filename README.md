Signs Your Cat May Be Trying To Kill You

Seems mighty chummy with the dog all of a sudden. 

He actually *does* have your tongue. 

You find a stash of 'Feline of Fortune' magazines behind the couch. 

Cyanide pawprints all over the house. 

You wake up to find a bird's head in your bed. 

As the wind blows over the grassy knoll in downtown Dallas, you get a faint whiff of catnip. 

Droppings in litter box spell out 'REDRUM.' 

Catch him with a new mohawk looking in the mirror saying, 'Mew looking at me? Mew looking at me?' 

Takes attentive notes every time 'Itchy and Scratchy' are on. 

You find blueprints for a Rube Goldberg device that starts with a mouse chased into a hole and ends with flaming oil dumped on your bed. 

Has taken a sudden interest in the wood chipper.

Instead of dead birds, leaves cartons of Marlboros on your doorstep. 

Ball of yarn playfully tied into a hangman's noose.

You find a piece of paper labelled 'MY WIL' which says 'LEEV AWL 2 KAT.' 

Now sharpens claws on your car's brake lines.
