The Postcard

'And will there be anything else, sir?' the bellboy asked after setting out an elaborate dinner for two.

'No, thank you,' the gentleman replied. 'That will be all.'

As the young man turned to leave, he noticed a beautiful satin negligee on the bed. 'Anything for your wife?' he asked.

'Yeah! That's a good idea,' the fellow said...

'Please bring up a postcard. I'll mail her a note!'
