The Frog and Golf

A man takes a day off work and decides to go out golfing. He is on the second hole, when he notices a frog sitting next to the green. He thinks nothing of it, and is about to shoot when he hears

 'Ribbit, 9 iron'

 The man looks around and doesn't see anybody. So he gets ready again, when he hears 

'Ribbit 9 iron'

 He looks at the frog, and decides to prove him wrong. He puts away his club, and gets a 9 iron. 

He whacked that ball, and it landed 10 in. from the cup! He was shocked, and looked at the frog, 'Wow, that was amazing' he said 'You must be a lucky frog then.'

'Ribbit, Lucky Frog'

The man takes the frog to the next hole. 'What do you think?' he said. 

'Ribbit, 3 wood'

The man takes out his 3 wood, and hit the ball. Hole in 1! He was befuddled, and didn't know what to say. 

He took the frog to every hole, and he golfed his best game.

'OK,' said the man 'Where to next?'

'Ribbet, Las Vegas'

So off they went, to Las Vegas. When they arive, he asks, 'Now what?' 

'Ribbit, Roulette Wheel'

'What should I bet?'

'Ribbit, $3000, black 6'

After the luck at golfing, the man says, 'What the hell.' 

Then, suddenly loads of  cash came sliding across the table; he got it.

He takes his winnings and buys the best hotel room, and he, of course, brings the frog.

'Frog, you have won me all this money, and I do not know how to repay you.'

'Ribbit, Kiss Me'

'Well, I guess...'



POOF........

The frog becomes a 10 year old boy. 'And that, your honor, is how the boy got into my room. So help me God, if my name is not....
