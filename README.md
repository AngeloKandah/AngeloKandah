Now, Where Was I?

Leonid Brezhnev, a former ruler of Russia, was thought not to be too bright. He comes to address a big Communist party meeting, and starts:

'Dear Comrade Imperialists,'

The whole hall perked up - 'what did he say?' Brezhnev tried again...

'Dear Comrade Imperialists,'

Well, by now the hall was in pandemonium - was he trying to call them Imperialists? Then, an advisor walked over to the podium and pointed to the speech for Brezhnev. 'Oh...' he muttered, and started again:

'Dear Comrades, Imperialists are everywhere.'
