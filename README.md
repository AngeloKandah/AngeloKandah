Why?

You know how young children have that special hobby of always asking 'Why?' Well, one day I went to the bank to pay some bills, and my 4-year-old daughter did just so.

'Mommy, why are we coming here?'
'So mommy can pay some bills.'
'Why?'
'So that we can keep our house.'
'Why?'
'So that we won't have to live on the streets.'
'Why?'
'Because that's what will happen if we don't pay for our house.'
'Why?'
'Because that's the way it goes.'
'Why?'
'Why do you keeping asking 'why?'.'
'...why?'
'You're being a nuisance.'
'Why?'
'Because you got that from your father.'
'Why?'
'Because your father is a nuisance.'
'Why?'
'I don't know, you go ask HIM and then tell me why.'
