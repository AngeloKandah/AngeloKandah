Predicting The Weather

A film crew was on location deep in the desert. One day, an old Indian went up to the director and said, 'Tomorrow storm.' The next day there was a sandstorm.

Several days later, the Indian went up to the director and said, 'Tomorrow rain.' The next day it rained for the entire day.

'This Indian is amazing,' said the director. He told his secretary to hire the Indian to predict the weather. However, after several successful predictions, the old Indian failed to show up for a couple of weeks.

Finally, the director sent for him. 'I have a big scene to shoot tomorrow,' the director said, 'and I'm counting on you. What will the weather be like?'

'Not know,' replied the Indian, shrugging his shoulders. 'Radio broken!'
