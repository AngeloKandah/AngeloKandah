Improvements

An engineer died and ended up in Hell. He was not pleased with the level of comfort in Hell, and began to redesign and build improvements. After a while, they had toilets that flush, air conditioning, and escalators. Everyone grew very fond of him. 
One day God called to Satan to mock him, 'So, how's it going down there in Hell?' 

Satan replied, 'Hey, things are great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next.' 

God was surprised, 'What? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake. He should never have gone down there in the first place. Send him back up here.' 

'No way,' replied Satan. 'I like having an engineer, and I'm keeping him.' 

God threatened, 'Send him back up here now or I'll sue!' 

Satan laughed and answered, 'Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?'
