Geriatic Humor II

Two elderly women were eating at a restaurant one morning. Ethel noticed something funny about Mabel's ear and she said, 'Mabel, did you know you've got a suppository in your left ear?'
 
Mabel answered, 'I have? A suppository?' She pulled it out and stared at it. Then she said, 'Ethel, I'm glad you saw this thing. Now I think I know where my hearing aid is.'
