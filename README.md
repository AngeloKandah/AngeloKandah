Pointing is Rude!

Rose, a mother of two boys, Jim and Ralph, heard yelling from upstairs. She heard several phrases like 'I got you!' and 'No, you didn't!' She ran to see what the yelling was about. It ended up that the two boys were playing cops and robbers, and were trying to shoot each other with their fingers.

'Jim! Haven't I taught you not to point! Fake guns are no excuse!'

'...But mum!' Jim replied after a short pause, 'I'm giving him the thumbs up, too!'
