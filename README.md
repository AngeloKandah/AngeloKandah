The Poker Player

A man walks into a bar and notices that there is a game of poker taking place at a table in the corner of the room.
To his amazement, one of the players is a German Shepherd, studying his hand intently.
He asks the barman, 'Is that dog actually playing poker?'
'He certainly is, sir,' replies the barman.
'I am amazed,' said the man.
'Oh, it's quite true, every night, the same group comes in here and they all play poker.'
'Does the dog win much?' asks the man.
'No, he's terrible, every time he gets a good hand, his tail starts to wag!'
