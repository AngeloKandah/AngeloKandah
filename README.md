Lunch

The teacher of the earth science class was lecturing on map reading. 

After explaining about latitude, longitude, degrees and minutes the teacher asked, 'Suppose I asked you to meet me for lunch at 23 degrees, 4 minutes north latitude and 45 degrees, 15 minutes east longitude...?' 

After a confused silence, a voice volunteered, 'I guess you'd be eating alone.'
