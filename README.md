Good Morning, Sisters

A young priest gets up in the morning and goes to breakfast. On his way there, two nuns look at him and he says, 'Good morning, Sisters,' and they reply, 'You got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.'

This stuns the priest, who thought he had been very polite, but he just goes on. He encounters a Brother a little while later along the way and he says, 'Good morning, Brother.' The Brother replies, 'You got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.' The priest was very confused at this and goes on.

He gets a little farther and he comes across a fellow priest and he says, 'Good morning, Father.' The priest replies, 'You got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.' Now the priest was mad. He continues his walk to the dining hall not saying a word to anyone. The Bishop sees him and says, 'Father ...' The young priest was not going to take any more even from the bishop. He looks at the bishop and says, 'No, I did not get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.' The bishop looks at him stunned and says, 'What?' The priest realised his mistake and said, 'I am sorry, your holiness, what is it you want?' The bishop looks at him and says, 'I was only going to ask you why you had on Sister Ann's shoes?'
