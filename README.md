Little johnny was going to school.
Incredibly he found a genie and was given 3 wishes.
'Can I have a piece of candy?' he said.
'Kid, I am a powerful genie ask for something else.'

'Mmmm, ok, give me 2 pieces of candy.'
'You think I have time for such small wishes?  Don't ask for something so small.'

'I want candy.' 

'Ok kid here you go; infinite candy.'
'Cool, thank you.' 

'Ok whats your second wish?  Kid, i don't have all day.' 
'But I still have 3 wishes..'
