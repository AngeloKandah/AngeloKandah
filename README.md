Restaurant

A family was eating out at a restaurant. The waiter who had been standing by them said in quite an upset manner 'Well I guess I'm gonna go home, make myself a cold tuna sandwich, watch the news, and then cry myself to sleep again.' The mother of the family looks at him in pity and says ' would you like to join us?' The waiter shouts back, 'Did you not just hear me?! I have an evening planned!'
