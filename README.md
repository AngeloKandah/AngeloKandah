It's All in the Name

Nathan goes to see his doctor. After a lengthy examination the doctor sighs, and says, 'I've some bad news for you, Nathan. You have an incurable cancer. I suggest you quickly put your affairs in order.' Nathan is initially shocked, but then, being a calm, solid character, he composes himself and quietly leaves the doctor's office. His son Max is waiting for him.

'Max,' says Nathan, 'we celebrate when things are good and we sometimes celebrate when things are not so good. In my case, Max, things aren't so good - I have cancer, so I suggest we go to my golf club for a few drinks.' 4 or 5 glasses of whisky later, the two are feeling a little less sad. Then, after a few laughs and some more glasses of whisky, they are approached by two of Nathan's club mates, curious as to what Nathan and Max are celebrating.

Nathan tells them, 'Guys, we're drinking to my impending death. I've been diagnosed with AIDS.' His club mates are shocked. They give Nathan their condolences, have a couple of beers and leave. Max then says, 'Dad, you tell me you're dying of cancer yet you tell your friends you're dying of AIDS. I don't understand.'

Nathan replies, 'I don't want any of them sleeping with your mother after I'm gone.'
