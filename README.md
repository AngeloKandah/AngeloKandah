Two Priests Were Going to Hawaii...

Two priests were going to Hawaii on vacation and decided that they would make this a real vacation by not wearing anything that would identify them as clergy. As soon as the plane landed, they headed for a store and bought some really outrageous shorts and shirts, sandals, sunglasses, etc.

The next morning, the two priests went to the beach, dressed in their 'tourist' garb and were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a 'drop dead' gorgeous blonde in a tiny bikini came walking straight toward them.  They couldn't help but stare but when she passed them she turned to them, smiled and said, 'Good morning, Father; good morning, Father,' nodding and addressing each of them individually, then passed on by. They were both stunned - how in the world did she recognize them as priests?

The next day, the two priests went back to the store, bought even more outrageous outfits - these were so loud, you could hear them before you even saw them, and again they settled on the beach in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine.

After a while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a string bikini this time, came walking toward them again. Again, she approached them and greeted them individually:  'Good morning, Father; good morning, Father,' and started to walk away.  One of the priests couldn't stand it and said, 'Just a minute young lady. Yes, we are priests, and proud of it, but I have to know; how in the world did YOU know?'

'Oh, Father, don't you recognize me?  I'm Sister Kathryn!'
