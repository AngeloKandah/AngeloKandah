A Night to Remember

A wealthy couple had planned to go out for the evening. The woman of the house decided to give their butler, Jerves, the rest of the night off. She said they would be home very late, and that he should just enjoy his evening. 

As it turned out, however, the wife wasn't having a good time at the party, so she came home early, alone. Her husband had to stay with the others since several of his important clients were there. 

As the woman walked into her house, she saw Jerves 
sitting by himself in the dining room. She called for 
him to follow her, and led him into the master bedroom. She then closed and locked the door. 

She looked at him and smiled. 'Jerves,' she said, 'take off my dress.' He did this carefully. 'Jerves,' she continued, 'take off my stockings and garter.' He silently obeyed her. 'Jerves,' she then said, 'remove my bra and panties.' As he did this, the tension continued to mount. 

She looked at him and then said, 'Jerves, if I ever 
catch you wearing my clothes again, you're fired!'
