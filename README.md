Amputation

A patient wakes up after having surgery to remove a gangrenous leg.

Doctor:  'I have good news and bad news.'
Patient:  'What's the bad news?'
Doctor: 'The bad news is that we amputated the wrong leg.'
Patient: 'That's terrible!  What's the good news?'
Doctor: 'We think the other leg is going to make it alright.'
