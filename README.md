The Unkindest Cut

A machine operator comes home from the factory and tells his wife, 'Honey, I've got some good news and some bad news. First, the good news, I got $25,000 severance pay!'

His wife said, '$25,000 in severance pay? That's great! So what's the bad news?'

He said, 'Wait till you hear what was severed!'
