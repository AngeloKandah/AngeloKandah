Drunk Man Home

A man is in a bar and falling off his stool every couple of minutes. He is obviously drunk. So the bartender says to another man in the bar: 'Why don't you be a good samaritan and take him home.' 

The man takes the drunk out the door, and to his car, and he stumbles at least ten times. They drive along and the drunk points out his house to the man. He stops the car, and the drunk stumbles up the steps to his house with the man. 

The drunk's wife greets them at the door: 'Why thank you for bringing him home for me, but where's his wheel chair?'
