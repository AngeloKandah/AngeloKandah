Hello, Dear

A woman phones up her husband at work for a chat.

HIM 'I'm sorry dear but I'm up to my neck in work today.'

HER 'But I've got some good news and some bad news for you dear.'

HIM 'OK, darling, but as I've got no time now, just give me the good news.'

HER 'Well, the air bag works.'
