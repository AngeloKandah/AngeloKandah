The Court Case

This is a true story.

This happened many years ago, and was told me by a man with spare time on his hands, who used to spectate in court to pass some of that spare time.

Lawyer - 'You say you saw the defendant's car involved in a road accident at the junction of X and Y?'

Policeman - 'That is correct.'

L - 'And where were you at this time?' P - 'At the junction of X and Z.'

L - 'So you were some 80 yards away when the incident occurred?' P - 'Yes, I was.'

L, in incredulous accent - 'So you were 80 yards away, but you say you knew this vehicle had been involved in an accident?' P - 'Yes.'

L - 'Then please tell the court how you knew this vehicle went through a red light?' P - 'Because the light that I could see was green.'

L, triumphantly - 'Ah, but how did you know that it had been in an accident?' P - 'Because it went past on its roof.'
