Goin' to Church

One Sunday morning a little girl in her Sunday best was running so she wouldn't be late for church. As she ran she kept praying, 'Dear God, please don't let me be late to church. Please don't let me be late to church....' And, as she was running she tripped and fell. 

When she got back up she began praying again, Please, God don't let me be late to church -- but don't shove me either!
