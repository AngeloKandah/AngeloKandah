The Advertiser

John had been working for an Advertising Firm for almost three years, and was getting a promotion, when his boss called him into his office.

'John, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to let you go. When I put you up for promotion, the company did a background check, and we found out that you got kicked out of Yale for lying about getting your diploma. I'm sorry, but I need you out within the hour.' 

'But I've been working so hard, I've been doing such good work,' John said 

'I'm sorry, John, but we can't have liars working for us.'

'But this is an advertising firm!'
