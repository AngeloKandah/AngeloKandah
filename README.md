The Letter

A woman was missing her boyfriend, so she decided to write him the following brief letter:

Dear Anthony,

I've been unable to sleep since I broke off our engagement. Won't you forgive and forget? Your absence is breaking my heart. I was a fool... nobody can take your place. I love you.

All my love,
Kathy
xoxo

P.S. Congratulations on winning this week's lottery...
