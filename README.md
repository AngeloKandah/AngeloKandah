Whats a Joke Subscription?

Not to be confused with the Daily Joke Newsletter, a subscription to a joke means that it will appear on your 'View Subscriptions' page. This allows you to keep up-to-date on the conversation/comments of your favorite jokes. To subscribe, click the checkbox at the bottom of the comment box on the joke page. You can always unsubscribe at any time.
