Game Warden

A farmer and his friend were leaning on a fence chatting.
Suddenly, the local Game Warden showed up and insisted on checking the farmer's property and, in particular, a certain field. The farmer refused to allow him access to the field but the Warden insisted he had the right, saying, 'I'm the Game Warden and I have a card! This card allows me to go in.' Before the farmer could stop him, the Warden was off into the field.

Soon, a horrifying scream pierced the air and the Warden, being chased by a massive bull, reappeared running for his life. 'Help, help!' he cried.

The farmer shouted back, 'Show him your card! Show him your card!'
