Press Release

Scare At Adelaide F.C. (Football Club) Headquarters

Training at West Lakes was delayed nearly two hours late this morning, after a player reported finding an unknown white powdery substance on the ground.

Initially the Club thought it was a prank!

Team manager Neil Craig immediately suspended training, while police and the ASIO (Australia Special Investigations Office) were called to investigate.

After a complete analysis, SA Police forensic experts determined that the white substance, unfamiliar to most of the players, was in fact, the goal line.

Practice will resume this afternoon after police and ASIO decided the team was unlikely to encounter the substance again.
