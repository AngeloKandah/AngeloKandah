Don't Eat the Brown Ones

A guy took his girlfriend to the movies. During the pre-views, she asked him if he would go and buy her some M JOKE Ms. 
When he returned with her candy, she opened the bag, picked out all the brown ones and threw them away. 

'What did you do that for?' he asked her. 

'I'm allergic to chocolate!' she replied.
