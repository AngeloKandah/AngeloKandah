STDs are deadly!

Bill walked into his favorite dive bar, took his regular stool, looked around, and asked Louie, the bartender, 'Where's Beverly, the waitress?'

'She's dead,' replied the bartender. 

'Dead?' asked Bill. 

'She died from herpes,' said the bartender. 

Bill replied, 'You don't die from herpes.' 

'You do if you give it to Big Louie!' said the bartender.
