The Coin Toss

A U.S. Mint spokesperson announced the plans for a new fifty-cent piece that was being issued in the honor of two great American patriots. On one side of the coin would be Theodore Roosevelt, on the other, Nathan Hale. When questioned by a reporter why two people were going to appear on the same coin, the spokesperson replied, 'These two men were selected to simplify life for a vast majority of Americans.'

The reporter then asked, 'Could you explain how this would simplify life for Americans?'

The official responded, 'Certainly, I'd be happy to. Now, when they toss a coin, they can simply call Ted's or Hale's.'
