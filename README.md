Just Like Me

This is a joke to do to a very gullible person.  You start off by telling that person to say 'Just like me', whenever you say something.  You then start:
'I went to my house'
Just like me.
'And walked through the door'
just like me
'and up the stairs'
just like me
'and then I walked down the hall'
just like me
'and opened the door to my room'
just like me
' And then I heard a noise'
just like me
' and I looked out my window'
just like me
'And saw a monkey that looked'
just like me
