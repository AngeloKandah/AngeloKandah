Hot Pursuit

Two Alabama State Trooper Patrol cars were in hot pursuit of a Camaro heading east towards Georgia on I-90. 

When the suspect crossed the Georgia line, the first trooper pulled over immediately. The rookie Trooper pulled over right behind him and asked, 'Sarge, why'd you stop?'

'You dumb rookie,' replied the Sarge. 'He's in Georgia now. They're an hour ahead of us, so we'll never catch him.'
