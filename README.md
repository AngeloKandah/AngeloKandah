Aerial Luck

Halfway along a commercial flight, a stewardess spoke out to the surprised passengers,

'Ladies and gentlemen! We have the honor to announce that you happen to be aboard the 10,001st flight of Good Grace Airlines! To celebrate this historic event, we are glad to give each of you a special valuable gift.'

The passengers immediately broke into a cheerful applause, congratulating each other on the sudden luck they had. Then one man said aloud,

'This is really exciting! But why didn't you choose the 10,000th flight? I suppose it's a better number for a celebration.'

'Certainly we did,' replied the stewardess, 'but unfortunately, because that flight crashed, we decided to shift the celebration.'
