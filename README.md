The Lost Purse

A lady lost her handbag during a day of shopping. It was found by an honest little boy and returned to her. Looking in her purse, she commented, 'Hmmm.... That's funny. When I lost my bag there was a $20 bill in it. Now there are twenty singles.'
The boy replied, 'That's right, lady. The last time I found a lady's purse, she didn't have change for a reward.'
