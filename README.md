She Could be My Twin

Two friends went to the mall to go shopping; one was a brunette and the other was blonde.
As they were shopping, the blonde suddenly said: 'That girl could pass as my twin.'
The brunette starts laughing. The blonde says: 'What is so funny?' The brunette says, 'That was a mirror.'
