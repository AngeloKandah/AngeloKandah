Picture Contest

A lady named Annala had 4 children.
They didn't spent a lot of time together.
One day Annala's husband said,'How about having a picture contest, so we can have a great time! We can invite the whole family; Grandma, Grandpa, and the rest of the gang!'

The mother accepted the challenge.
The day of the picture contest everyone was there.
So far everyone had very lovely pictures.

A picture of a flower, a picture of a cat, a picture of a dog, and a picture of a duck.
The youngest child was the last.
Everyone was cheering while he was presenting.
He proudly announced, 'This great picture I made is of my mommy and daddy wrestling on the bed!'
