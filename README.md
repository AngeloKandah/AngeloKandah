Top 14 Fun Things To Do In A Public Bathroom

14. Using a small squeeze tube, spread peanut butter on a wad of toilet paper and drop the wad under the stall wall of your neighbor; then say, 'Whoops, could you kick that back over here please?' 

13. Fill a balloon with creamed corn. Rush into the stall with your hand over your mouth and let out a lengthy vomit impression while you squeeze the balloon and splatter cream corn all about. Apologize profusely and blame it on the fettuccine alfredo you had for breakfast. 

12. Take in a wineskin filled with water. Stand and slowly squeeze it out into the toilet, every 15-20 seconds moan or sigh. 

11. Say, 'Boy, that sure looks like a maggot.' 

10. Before you unroll toilet paper, conspicuously lay down your 'Cross-Dressers Anonymous' newsletter on the floor visible to the adjacent stall. 

9. Lower a small mirror underneath the stall wall, adjust it so you can see your neighbor and say, 'Peek-a-boo!' 

8. Stick your open palm under the stall wall and ask your neighbor, 'May I borrow a highlighter?' 

7. Cheer and clap loudly every time somebody breaks the silence with a bodily function noise. 

6. Say, 'Hmmm, I've never seen that color before.' 

5. Grunt and strain real loud for 30 seconds and then drop a cantaloupe into the toilet bowl from a height of 6 feet. Sigh relaxingly. 

4. Say, 'Now how did that get there?' 

3. Say, 'Interesting... more floaters than sinkers.' 

2. After flushing, say, 'Darn, I knew that drain hole was a little too small. Now what am I gonna do?' 

1. Fill a large flask with Mountain Dew. Squirt it erratically under the stall walls of your neighbors while yelling, 'Whoa! Easy boy!'
