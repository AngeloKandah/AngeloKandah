The Dress of Love!

An old woman went to visit her daughter and she found her naked, waiting for her husband. 

The mother asks the daughter, 'What are you doing naked?' 

The daughter responds, 'This is the dress of love.' 

When the mother returns home, she strips naked and waits for her husband. 

When her husband arrives, he asks her, 'What are you doing naked?' 

She responds, 'This is the dress of love.' 

'Well,' he says to her, 'go iron it.'
