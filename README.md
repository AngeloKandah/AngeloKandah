A Meeting With the Board

After a long, dry sermon, the minister announced that he wished to meet with the church board after the service. The first man to arrive was a stranger.

'You misunderstood my announcement. This is a meeting of the board,' said the minister.

'I know,' said the man. 'If there is anyone here more bored than I am, I'd like to meet him.'
