Debate

Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews
had to leave Italy. There was, of course, a huge outcry from
the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He would
have a religious debate with a leader of the Jewish
community. If the Jewish leader won the debate, the Jews
would be permitted to stay in Italy. If the Pope won, the
Jews would have to leave. 

The Jewish community met and picked an aged Rabbi, Moishe,
to represent them in the debate. Rabbi Moishe, however, could
not speak Latin and the Pope could not speak Yiddish. So it
was decided that this would be a 'silent' debate. 

On the day of the great debate, the Pope and Rabbi Moishe
sat opposite each other for a full minute before the Pope
raised his hand and showed three fingers. 

Rabbi Moishe looked back and raised one finger. 

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. 

Rabbi Moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. 

The Pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of
wine. 

Rabbi Moishe pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood
up and said, 'I concede the debate. This man has bested me.
The Jews can stay.' 

Later, the Cardinals gathered around the Pope, asking him
what had happened. 

The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent
the Trinity. He responded by holding up one finger to remind
me that there was still one God common to both our religions.
Then I waved my finger around me to show him that God was all
around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show
that God was also right here with us. I pulled out the wine
and the wafer to show that God absolves us of our sins. He
pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. He had an
answer for everything. What could I do?' 

Meanwhile, the Jewish community crowded around Rabbi Moishe,
asking what happened. 'Well,' said Moishe, 'first he said to
me, 'You Jews have three days to get out of here.' So I said
to him, 'Up yours'. Then he tells me the whole city would be
cleared of Jews. So I said to him, 'Listen here Mr. Pope, the
Jews ... we stay right here!' 

'And then?' asked a woman. 

'Who knows?' said Rabbi Moishe. 'We broke for lunch.'
