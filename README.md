Waiters and Spoons

At a restaurant, one of the customers noticed that all of the waiters had two spoons in their vest pockets. Upon being asked, one waiter said, 'We see that the most frequently dropped silverware are spoons, therefore we keep them for replacement.' 
Then the customer noticed that a string was hanging out of all the waiters' flies and asked what the string was for. 'The string is for us to go to the bathroom,' explained the waiter, 'that way, when we pull it, it shoots and aims right away. Then we don't have to stop to wash our hands.' 

The customer asked, 'Well, that's how you get it out, but how do you get it back in?' 

The waiter whispered confidentially, 'I don't know about the others, but I use the two spoons.'
