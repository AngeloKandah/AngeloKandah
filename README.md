Keep Your Head Down

A young man is playing golf with a priest. At a short hole the priest asks, 'What are you going to use on this hole son?'

The young man says, 'An eight iron, father. How about you?'

The priest says, 'I'm going to hit a soft seven and pray.'

The young man hits his eight iron and puts the ball on the green. The priest tops his 7 iron and dribbles the ball out a few yards.

The young man says, 'I don't know about you father, but in my church when we pray, we keep our head down.'
