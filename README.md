Shipwrecked

Once upon a time, and unfortunate event took place, in which a ship sank in high seas and the following people got stranded on a beautiful deserted island in the middle of nowhere: 

 A.            2 Italian men and 1 Italian woman
 B.            2 French men and 1 French woman
 C.            2 German men and 1 German woman
 D.            2 Greek men and 1 Greek woman
 E.            2 Polish men and 1 Polish woman
 F.            2 Mexican men and 1 Mexican woman
 G.            2 American men and 1 American woman
 H             2 Indian men and 1 Indian woman

What a Crazy coincidence! One month later, on various parts of the island, the following was observed: 

A. One Italian man killed the other Italian man for the Italian woman.
 
B. The two French men and the French woman are living happily together.
 
C. The two German men have a strict weekly schedule of when they spend time with the German woman.

D. The two Greek men are happy together, and the Greek woman is
cooking and cleaning for them.

E. The two Polish men took a long look at the endless ! ocean and a
long look at the Polish woman, and they started swimming.

F. The two Mexican men are talking to all the other men on the island trying to sell them the Mexican woman.

G. The two American men are contemplating suicide. The American
woman is bitching about her body being her own, the true nature of feminism, how she can do everything that they can do, about the necessity of fulfillment, the equal division of the household chores, how her last boyfriend respected her opinion and treated her much better, and how her relationship with her mother is improving.

H. What happened to the Indians????
