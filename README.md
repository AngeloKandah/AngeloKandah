Happy Butt

It was this little girl's first day of school and the teacher asked her what her name was and she replied, 'Happy Butt.' The teacher said, 'Honey I don't think that's your name you need to go to the principal's office and get this straightened out.' So she went to the principal's office and he asked, 'What's your name?' And the little girl said, 'Happy Butt.' The principal called the girl's mother to get this straightened out once and for all. After getting off the phone he looked at the little girl and said, 'Honey, your name's is Gladys, not Happy Butt.' The girl then exclaimed, 'Glad Ass, Happy Butt what's the difference?'
