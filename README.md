Read the Signs

One Christmas, a parent decided that she was no longer going to remind her children of their thank-you note duties. As a result, their grandmother did not receive acknowledgments of the generous checks she had given.

However, things were different the following year.

'The children came over in person to thank me,' the grandparent told a friend triumphantly.

'How wonderful!' the friend exclaimed. 'What do you think caused the change in their behavior?'

'Oh, that's easy,' the grandmother replied. 'This year I didn't sign the checks.'
