Mother-in-law

Bill went on a vacation to the Middle East with most of his family including his mother-in-law. During their vacation and while they were visiting Jerusalem, Bill's mother-in-law died. With the death certificate in hand, Bill went to the American Consulate Office to make arrangements to send the body back to the States for proper burial.

The Consul after hearing of the death of the mother-in-law told Bill, 'My friend, the cost of sending of a body back to the States for burial is very very expensive. It could cost as much as $5,000.00 dollars.'

The Consul continues, in most cases the person responsible for the remains, normally decides to bury the body here. This would only cost $150.00 dollars. Bill thinks for some time and answers the Consul, 'I don't care how much it will cost to send the body back; that's what I want to do.'

The Consul after hearing this says, 'You must have loved your mother-in-law very much considering the difference in price from $5.000.00 and $150.00 dollars.'

'No, it's not that at all,' says Bill. 'You see, I know of a case many years ago of a person who was buried here in Jerusalem and on the third day He was resurrected. I don't want to take that chance!'
