It's True!!

One bright day in the middle of the night, 
2 dead boys got up to fight
back to back they faced each other,
drew their knives,
and shot each other.
a deaf policeman heard the noise, 
and came to kill those two dead boys.
if you don't believe my stories true,
ask the blind guy, he saw it to!
