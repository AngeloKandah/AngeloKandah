I Wish There was Something Between Us

There was a really dramatic woman and a small man.

The small man worked at a ballroom.  The woman got dressed up all fancy and went to the ballroom. She went up to the man and said, 'I hope there is something between us!

And the little man said, 'Me too!  A continent!'
