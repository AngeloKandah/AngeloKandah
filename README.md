Married

Little Johnny and Susie were only 10 years old, but they just knew that they were in love. One day they decided that they wanted to get married, so Johnny went to Susie's father to ask him for her hand.

Johnny bravely walked up to him and said 'Mr. Smith, me and Susie are in love and I want to ask you for her hand in marriage.'

Thinking that this was the cutest thing, Mr. Smith replied, 'Well Johnny, you are only 10. Where will you two live?'

Without even taking a moment to think about it, Johnny replied 'In Susie's room. It's bigger than mine and we can both fit there nicely.'

Still thinking this is just adorable, Mr. Smith said with a huge grin, 'Okay then how will you live? You're not old enough to get a job. You'll need to support Susie.'

Again, Johnny instantly replied, 'Our allowance... Susie makes 5 bucks a week and I make 10 bucks a week. That's about 60 bucks a month, and that'll do us just fine.'

By this time Mr. Smith was a little shocked that Johnny had put so much thought into this. So, he thought for a moment trying to come up with something that Johnny wouldn't have an answer for.

After a second, Mr. Smith said, 'Well Johnny, it seems like you have got everything all figured out. I just have one more question for you. What will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own?'

Johnny just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Well, we've been lucky so far....'
