Spooked Cab Driver

A man was riding in a cab one day when he decided to tap the cab driver on the shoulder to request an alternate route.

The cab driver screams his head off and loses control of the cab, causing it to slam into a lightpost.

After checking themselves out the man says, 'I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so jumpy.'

To which the cab driver replies, 'It's not your fault. Today is my first day as a cab driver after driving a hearse for 10 years.'
