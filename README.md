Animal Super Bowl

It was Superbowl Sunday for the animals, and the Elephants were playing the Cows. The whole first half of the game, the Elephants got their butts whipped. The cows were winning by a mile. By halftime, the Elephants were about ready to give up. But at the start of the second half, a new player ran on to the field. It was a Centipede! He was so fast the cows couldn't even get within five feet of him. In no time, the Elephants had twice as many points as the cows. 
At the end of the game, the coach of the Elephants thanked the centipede for helping them win the Super Bowl. 'But I just want to know, why didn't you come out until halftime?'
The centipede answered, 'It took me that long to put my shoes on!'
