Oklahoma

At a southern university, students in the psychology program were attending their first class on emotional extremes. 
'Just to establish some parameters,' said the professor to the student from Arkansas, 'what is the opposite of joy?' 

'Sadness,' said the student. 

'And the opposite of depression?' he asked of the young lady from Oklahoma. 

'Elation,' she said. 

'And you sir,' he said to the young man from Texas, 'what about the opposite of woe?' 

The Texan replied, 'Sir, I believe that would be'giddy up' '.
