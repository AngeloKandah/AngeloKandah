Why Not?

A mom was wanting to get her boobs enlarged. Unfortunately for her, she didn't have enough money to get it done. In fact, she had exactly half the money needed.  She was telling her son, Little Benny, 'Honey, Mommy really wants to get a boob job.  But Mommy has only half the money.'  She hung her head, and her son said puzzled, 'Well why can't mommy just pick one?'
