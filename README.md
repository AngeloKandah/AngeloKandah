My Summer Vacation

Summer was over and the teacher was asking the class about their vacations.

She turned to little Johnny and asked what he did over the summer. 'We visited my grandmother in Minneapolis, Minnesota,' he said.

'That sounds like an excellent vocabulary word,' the teacher said, 'Can you tell the class how you spell that?'

Little Johnny thought about it and said, 'Come to think of it, she lives in Ohio.'
