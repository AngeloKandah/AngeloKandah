The Rooms

A man dies and goes to hell. When he arrives Satan gives him a choice of what eternal punishment he'll be given.
They go to a wall with 3 doors. Satan opens the first door and there are people standing on their heads on blocks of ice.
The man says, 'No way, I cant do this punishment.'  So they move on to the next room.
Satan opens the second door and there are people standing on their heads on a brick floor.
The man says, 'No way, that would give me headaches forever.' So they move on to the next room.
Satan opens the door and inside there are people sitting in cow manure drinking tea and eating cookies.
The man figures it can't be that bad so he chooses to spend eternity in that room.
Just before Satan closes the door he yells back, 'Alrite break time is over! Back on your heads!'
