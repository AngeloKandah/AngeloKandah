Wanna Have Sex?

Four friends are at a bar one night when they spy a gorgeous woman sitting down at a table. They know they can't all have her so they decide to take turns trying to get the girl. The first friend walks up to the woman and says 'Is it hot in here or is it just you'? The woman replies by turning away and the man plods back sadly to his friends. The second friend sits down next to her and very romantically states 'heaven must be missing an angel'. The lady tells him to leave so he goes back to sit with his friends. The third friend orders her a drink and sits down with her. He places his hand on her leg and before he can utter a word she calls security and he gets thrown out the bar. The fourth and final friend walks over to her table and bluntly says 'want to go have unprotected sex'? They became married 2 months later.
