The Honest Lawyer

An independent woman started her own business. She was shrewd and diligent, so business kept coming in. Pretty soon she realized she needed an in-house counsel and so she began interviewing young lawyers.

'As I'm sure you can understand,' she started off with one of the first applicants, 'in a business like this, our personal integrity must be beyond question.' She leaned forward; 'Mr. Peterson, are you an 'honest' lawyer?'

'Honest?' replied the job prospect. 'Let me tell you something about honest. Why, I'm so honest that my dad lent me fifteen thousand dollars for my education and I paid back every penny the minute I tried my very first case.'

'Impressive. And what sort of case was that?'

He squirmed in his seat and admitted, 'My dad sued me for the money.'
