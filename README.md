New Horse

Here are two versions of the same story--

A certain man was passing through a small town and wanted to upgrade his mode of transportation. So he looked all around this small town he was in and found that the only place he could buy a faster means of transportation was at the local monastery. They had a horse for sale there for quite a deal. When the man was leaving the monastery with his new horse the monk that was sold him the horse said 'Now all you have to remember is- When you want the horse to move all you need to say is 'Hallelujah' and when you want it to stop say 'Amen.'' The man then gave the monk a half acknowledged nod and continued on his way.
After several miles the man sneezed and spooked the horse. The horse started running faster and faster. Then the man noticed a cliff ahead of him and stared to panic and said a prayer when the traveler said 'Amen' the horse stopped right on the edge of the cliff. Then the man shouted and Praised God saying 'Hallelujah!'



A certain man traveling ran into a stroke of bad luck. His horse died when he was still traveling, but luckily he was only a few miles off of a small town. He reached the town and inquired where he would be able to find a horse and he was told that the only person who had horses in the town was the preacher. The man went to the preacher and asked if he could buy a horse. The preacher said: 'Why certainly I'll sell this one right here to you. But remember this; I trained my horses to move when you say 'Praise the Lord' and when you want the horse to stop say 'Amen.''
With that the man thanked the preacher and said 'Praise the Lord!' and the horse and the man immediately went riding away. While the man was riding along he noticed a cliff ahead of him and thought to himself 'What was it that the preacher told me to say to get this horse to stop?' he then tried 'Whoa whoa, Betsy!' but the horse kept on riding. The man finally so desperate said a prayer and at the end of his payer he said 'Amen.' The horse stopped right at the edge of the cliff. The man looked down the steep cliff and said 'Praise the Lord!'
