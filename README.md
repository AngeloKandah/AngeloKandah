My Old Man Is Home!

Bill pilled up a stool at his favorite bar and announced, 'My wife Suzie must love me more than any woman has ever loved any man!' 'What makes you say that?' the bartender inquired.  'Last week,' Bill explained, 'I had to take a couple of sick days from work. Suzie was so thrilled to have me around that every time the milkman and the post office guy came by, she'd run down the driveway, waving her arms and hollering, `My old man's home! My old man's home!''
