Two Kids in a Hospital

Two little kids are in a hospital, lying on stretchers next to each other, outside the operating room. 

The first kid leans over and asks, 'What are you in here for?' The second kid says, 'I'm in here to get my tonsils out and I'm a little nervous.' 

The first kid says, 'You've got nothing to worry about. I had that done when I was four. They put you to sleep, and when you wake up they give you lots of Jello and ice cream. It's a breeze.' 

The second kid then asks, 'What are you here for?' The first kid says, 'A circumcision.' 

The second kid replies, 'Whoa, Good luck buddy, I had that done when I was born. Couldn't walk for a year!
