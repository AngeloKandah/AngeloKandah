1/3 Multiplied By 3

An analyst, a pure mathematician, and a statistician apply for a job. The interviewer asks each of them the question 'What is 1/3 multiplied by 3?' The analyst enters it into his calculator and replies that the answer is 0.9999999. The pure mathematician replies that the answer is obviously 1. Then, the statistician asks the interviewer 'What do you want it to be?'
