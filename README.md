Four Catholic Women

Four Catholic women are sitting in a cafe sipping their tea, talking about their great sons. Soon it begins as a contest to see who has the best son.
The first woman proudly declares, 'My son is a priest. When he walks into a room people call him 'Father.'
The second woman replies even more proudly, 'My son is a bishop, when he walks into a room people call him 'My Grace.'
The third woman thinking she wins replies, 'My son is a Cardinal! When he walks into a room people say, 'My Eminence.'
The fourth woman says nothing but sips her tea quietly.
The three women stare at her and then ask her what is so special about her son.
With a smug look on her face she replies, 'My son is a 6' 5' muscular man, with a chiseled jaw and arms as big as pipes. And when he walks into a room all the woman say, 'Oh My God.'
