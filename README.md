Barbershop

A guy walks in to the Barbershop. Barber says, 'What will it be today?' Guy says, 'Well, I want it going with my waves on top, faded on one side, plug the other, and just make it all out of shape and messed up.' Barber says, 'Now why in the world do you want your hair cut like that?'

Guy says, 'That's how you cut it last time.'
