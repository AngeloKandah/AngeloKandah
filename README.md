Jewish, Too!

A young gay man calls home and tells his Jewish mother that he has decided to go back into the closet because he has met a wonderful girl and they are going to be married. He tells his mother that he is sure she will be happier since he knows that his gay lifestyle has been very disturbing to her. 
She responds that she is indeed delighted and asks tentatively, 'I suppose it would be too much to hope that she would be Jewish?' 

He tells her that not only is the girl Jewish, but is from a wealthy Beverly Hills family. She admits she is overwhelmed by the news, and asks, 'What is her name?' 

He answers, 'Monica Lewinsky.' 

There is a long pause, then his mother asks, 'What happened to that nice Catholic boy you were dating last year?'
