A Man Walks Into a Bar...

A man walks into a bar. He sees a good looking, smartly dressed woman perched on a bar stool. He walks up behind her and says, 'Hi there, good looking, how's it going?' 

Having already had a few power drinks, she turns around, faces him, looks him straight in the eye and says, 'Listen! I'll screw anybody, anytime, anywhere, your place, my place, front door, back door, it doesn't matter. I've been doing it ever since I got out of college. I just flat ass love it.' 

Eyes now wide with interest he says, 'No kidding, I'm a lawyer too! What firm are you with?'
