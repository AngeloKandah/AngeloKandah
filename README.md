Father's Day

It was Father's Day, and Little Billy's mom told him to tell his dad to just lay around, watch TV, and do nothing productive.

So Little Billy went into the family room where he found his dad watching TV. Little Billy said, 'Dad, it's Father's Day, so mom and me think that you should just lay around, watch TV, and do nothing productive.'  His dad looked up from the TV and smiled, then went back to watching his show.

Little Billy paused a moment and said, 'You know, just like you usually do...'
