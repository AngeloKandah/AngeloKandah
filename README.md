Six Retired Floridians...

Six retired Floridians were playing poker in the condo clubhouse when Meyerwitz loses $500 on a single hand, clutches his chest and drops dead at the table. 

Showing respect for their fallen comrade, the other five continue playing standing up. Finkelstein looks around and asks, 'So, who's gonna tell the wife?' They draw straws. Goldberg picks the short one. They tell him to be discreet, be gentle, don't make a bad situation any worse. 

'Discreet? I'm the most discreet man you'll ever meet. Discretion is my middle name. Leave it to me.' Goldberg goes over to the Meyerwitz apartment and knocks on the door. 

The wife answers and asks what he wants.

Goldberg declares, 'Your husband just lost $500 and is afraid to come home.' 

The wife says, 'Tell him to drop dead!' 

'I'll go tell him,' says Goldberg.
