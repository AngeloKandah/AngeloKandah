Dr. Hannibal Lecter

In a bi-partisan move, President Bush has nominated Dr. Hannibal Lecter as his candidate for US Surgeon General.

'I think Dr. Lecter will serve with pride, fava beans, and a nice Chianti,' Bush announced.

In another announcement, Special Agent Clarice Starling will become the new FBI director.  She's expected to work closely with the new Surgeon General on a case concerning missing former Vice President Al Gore.  President Bush had recently arranged a meeting between Gore and Lecter.  

Lecter was the last person to see Gore before Gore's sudden disappearance in early January.  Lecter noted that he, 'enjoyed having Gore for dinner,' but was upset at how Gore, or, rather the *subject* of Gore kept 'coming up.'  'I'm sick to my stomach over this,' Lecter said.

President Bush didn't seem concerned with the disappearance of his rival for the office.  'I think it's all crap by now, don't you?'
