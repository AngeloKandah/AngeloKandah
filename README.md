Suicide

A blonde decided to commit suicide by hanging herself from a tree in the park. 

A few days later, a man was walking his dog and spotted her hanging from the tree. He asks the blonde what she is doing and she replies, 'I'm hanging myself.'

'You're supposed to put the noose around your neck, not your waist,' said the onlooker. 'I tried that,' replied the blonde, 'but I couldn't breathe.'
