Don't Mess With a Marine...

An army 2Lt. is taking his platoon on patrol when his scouts come running back and say 
'Sir, there's a Marine standing in the road'. 
The Lt. scoffs and sends a fire team to go investigate and remove the Marine. 
They approach the Marine and he begins to head for a small ridge on the side of the road and motions for them to follow. 
As the rest of the platoon advances and takes cover they hear yelling and screaming. 
The Marine emerges a couple minutes of later and dusts himself off and again stands in the middle of the road.
The Lt. curses and calls for a squad to remove the Devil Dog. 
He again heads down to s small ridge and they follow. 
Once again there is blood-curdling screaming and weeping. 
And AGAIN the Marine emerges and dusts himself off.
Bewildered and pissed off, the Lt. sends all but his platoon Sgt. down and says 
'Eliminate the motherfu**er'. They run towards him and again follow him to the ridge. 
The screaming begins again and suddenly a specialist comes running up, bloody, his cammies all mangled. The Lt. is in shock and says 'What the hell is going on out there, soldier?' 
Gasping for breath the soldier replies, 
'It's a trick, sir! There's two of 'em.'
