Shoe Repair

A man and his wife were cleaning out their attic when the man found a shoe repair stub in the pocket of an old jacket.  'Hey - check this out,'  he said to his wife, 'this stub is 20 years old.  I wonder if the shop still has the shoes.'
So the next day the man went to the shoe shop and asked the owner if he still had the shoes.  The owner disappeared into the back of the shop for about five minutes.
When he returned, he replied happily, 'Yup, believe it or not, we've still got the shoes.  They'll be ready next Thursday.'
