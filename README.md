Why You Shouldn't Drink And Why You Should Feed Your Dogs

A man named John was walking back to his house, when a stranger walked up to him and said, 'I'll give you tree beans if you give me your house.' But John was drunk, so he thought he said, 'If you give me tree beans, I'll give you my house.'

So John said, 'Yes.' And while he was taking out some beans, the stranger gave him three beans and ran in his house. John hollered, 'WAIT! YOU HAVE TO FEED THE DOGS OR THEY WILL ATTACK YOU CRAZILY!' But the stranger didn't hear him fully and replied, 'Oh. Don't feed the dogs? O.k.!'

The next day the stranger came out, all torn up and came to John and said, 'I want my beans back.'
