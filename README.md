Roses are Red, Violets are Blue...

Roses are red, violets are blue, If I can use technology, why can't you?

The sky is blue, the grass is green, why is your brain as small as a lima bean?

Your humorous, funny, have OCD, How come you can't use technology without me?

I love you, I love you, I really do, but roses are red and violets are blue.
