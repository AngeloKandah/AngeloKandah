A Dedicated Teamsters Union...

A dedicated Teamsters Union worker was attending a  convention in Las Vegas and, as you would expect, decided to check out the local brothels nearby. When he got to the first one, he asked the Madam, 'Is this a union house?' 'No,' she replied, 'I'm sorry, it isn't.'

'Well, if I pay you $100.00, what cut do the girls get?'  'The house gets $80.00 and the girls get $20.00.'

Mightily offended at such unfair dealings, the man stomped off down the street in search of a more equitable, hopefully unionized, shop. His search continued until finally he reached a brothel where the Madam responded, 'Why, yes sir, this IS a Union House.'  
 
The man asked, 'And if I pay you $100.00, what cut do the girls get?'  'The girls get $80.00 and the house gets $20.'  That's more like it!' the UAW man said. He handed the Madam $100.00, looked around the room and pointed to a stunningly attractive blonde.  'I'd like her for the night.'   'I'm sure you would, sir,' said the Madam, then gesturing to an 85 year old woman in the corner, 'but Ethel here has seniority.'
