Now Get Your Mind Out of the Gutter....

I shall seek and find you,
I shall take you to bed and have my way with you,
I will make you ache, shake, and sweat until you moan and groan.
I will make you beg for mercy, you will beg for me to stop.
I will exhaust you to the point that you will be relieved when I'm finished with you.
 You will be weak for days.
You have been warned, my love, by...



THE FLU!!
Now get your mind out of the gutter and go get a flu shot.
