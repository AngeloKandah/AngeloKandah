Jumping From a Plane

The Pope, the smartest man in the world, a father, and a son were in a plane that was going to crash. There were only three parachutes in the plane. The Pope says to them, 'I need a parachute because I am worshiped by many people of religion.' So he takes a parachute and jumps. 

The smartest man in the world says, 'I am the smartest man in the world so I deserve a parachute.' He takes a parachute and jumps.

The father then looks at the son and says, 'I have lived a long life and I think you should take a parachute because you have so much to live for.'

The little boy looks at the dad and says, 'It's alright daddy. We can both go. The smartest man in the world took my backpack.'
