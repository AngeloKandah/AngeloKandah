Ladies Club

So ... the other day, my friends and I went to this 'Ladies Night Club.' 
One of the girls wanted to impress us, so she pulls out a $10 bill. 
The 'dancer' came over to us, and my friend licked the $10 and put it on his butt cheek. 
Not to be outdone, another friend pulls out a $20 bill. She calls the guy back over, licks the $20 bill and puts it on his other butt cheek. 
Still attempting to impress the rest of us, my other friend pulls out a $50 bill. She calls the guy back over again, licks the $50 bill and again puts it on one of his butt cheeks. Now the attention is focused on me. What could I do to top that? 
I got out my wallet, thought for a minute ... and then the financial analyst in me took over. I got out my ATM card, swiped it down the crack of his ass, grabbed the $80 bucks and went home!
