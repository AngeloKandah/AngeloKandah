Cheap Mistress

There was once a wife so jealous that when her husband came home one night and she couldn't find hairs on his jackets she yelled at him, 'Great, so now you're cheating on me with a bald woman!' 

The next night, when she didn't smell any perfume, she yelled again by saying, 'She's not only bald, but she's too cheap to buy any perfume!'
