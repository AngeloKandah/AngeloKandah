Nobody likes Bill Clinton

Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton, and George Washington were all on an airplane looking out the door. George Washington says, ' I'm going to make somebody happy'  then throws a $20 out of the plane. Bill Clinton says, 'I'm going to make two people happy'  then throws 2 $20's out of the plane. Abraham Lincoln says 'I'm going to make everybody happy'  and throws Bill Clinton out of the plane.
