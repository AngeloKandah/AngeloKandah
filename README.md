Overly Suspicious

Sometimes women are overly suspicious of their husbands. 

When Adam stayed out very late for a few nights, Eve became upset. 

'You're running around with other women,' she charged. 

'You're  being unreasonable,' Adam responded. 'You're the only woman on earth.' 

The quarrel continued  until Adam fell asleep, only to be awakened by someone poking him in the chest. It was Eve. 

'What do you think you're doing?' Adam demanded. 

'Counting your ribs,' said Eve.
