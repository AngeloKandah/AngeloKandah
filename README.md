Americanization (Hard 'R' Rating)

Two Saudis emigrated to America with their families.  On the plane ride over they made a bet about who could become more 'Americanized' in their first year.

As agreed, they met exactly one year later.  The first guy pulled up in his Hummer and said to the second guy 'I win.  There's no way you can beat me:  I just dropped my son off at Little League, I'm on my way to pick my daughter up from cheerleading practice, and I stopped at McDonalds on my way here.'

And the second guy said 'Fuck you, towelhead!'
