Sherlock Holmes in Heaven

Sherlock Holmes stood at the Gates of Heaven pulling at his pipe awaiting his turn. 'I'll let you in,' said St. Peter, gesturing toward the heavenly throngs behind him, 'if you'll tell me who among these was the first mortal.'

'Elementary, my dear St. Peter,' said the great detective, 'he's the one without a bellybutton.'
