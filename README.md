Tact

A man noted for his tact was awakened one morning at four o'clock by his ringing telephone. 'Your dog's barking, and it's keeping me awake,' said an irate voice.  The man thanked his caller and politely asked his name before hanging up.

The next morning at four o'clock, he called his neighbour back.  'Sir,' he said, 'I don't have a dog.'
