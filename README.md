Deer Hunting

George Bush senior and junior were dragging the deer they had just shot back to their truck. Another hunter approached, pulling his along, too.

'Sirs, I don't want to tell you how to do something,' he said, 'but I can tell you that it's much easier if you drag the deer the other way, then the antlers won't drag on the ground.'

After the other hunter left, they decided to try it. A little while later, George junior said to George senior, 'You know, that guy was right. This is a lot easier!'

'Yeah,' said George senior, 'but we're getting farther from the truck.'
