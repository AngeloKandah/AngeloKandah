Not Sticking!!

George W Bush wanted a special postage stamp issued, with his picture on it. He instructed his Postmaster General, stressing that it should be of international quality.

When the stamps were released, Bush heard complaints that the stamps were not sticking properly, and he become furious.

He called the chief of the Secret Service and ordered him to investigate the matter.

The chief checked the matter out at several post offices, and then reported on the problem to Bush.

He said, 'Sir, the stamp is really of international quality. The problem is, our citizens are spitting on the wrong side!'
