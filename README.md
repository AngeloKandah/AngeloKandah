Frank and Matt

Two college students, Frank and Matt, are riding on a New York City subway when a beggar approaches them asking for spare change.

Frank adamantly rejects the man in disgust.

Matt, on the other hand, whips out his wallet, pulls out a couple of singles and gladly hands them over to the beggar with a smile.

The beggar thanks him kindly and then continues on to the other passengers.

Frank is outraged by his friend's act of generosity.

'What on earth did you do that for?' shouts Frank., 'You know he's only going to use it on drugs or booze.'

Matt replies, 'And we weren't?'
