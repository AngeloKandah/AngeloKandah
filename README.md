CHRISTMAS

Five days before Christmas, Santa was having a horrible day.  And by horrible, I mean his wife was sick with the flu, 23 elfs called in sick, and nothing was getting done, so they were really behind schedule.  

*Knock-Knock,* Santa heard, so he went to go open the door.  There was an Angel carrying a christmas tree.  'Where would you like me to put this?' asked the angel. 

And that is why the Angel is put on top of the Christmas tree.
