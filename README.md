Business As Usual in the Vatican

During a Papal audience, a business man approached the Pope and made this offer: 

Change the last line of the Lord's prayer from 'give us this day our daily bread' to 'give us this day our daily chicken.' and KFC will donate 10 million dollars to Catholic charities. The Pope declined. 

Two weeks later the man approached the Pope again. This time with a 50 million dollar offer. Again the Pope delcined. A month later the man offers 100 million, this time the Pope accepts. 

At a meeting of the Cardinals, the Pope announces his decision in the good news/bad news format. 'The good news is... that we have 100 million dollars for charities. The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account!'
