Refund

It's my wife's birthday today so I went out earlier in the week and deliberately got her a present that I knew she'd hate. 

True to form she opened it, took one look and said, 'What the fuck would I want with an xbox? 

I'm going to take this back to the shop and ask for a refund.'

I can't wait to see her little face when she gets arrested for looting.
