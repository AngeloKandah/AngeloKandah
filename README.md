There's 1 redhead 1 brunette and 1 blonde. Their all at the NASA space center. The redhead says to the flight technician 'I want to go to the moon'. The flight technician says she can go tomorrow. The brunette says 'I want to go to Mars'. He says she can go next week. The blonde says 'I want to go to the sun'. The flight technician says, 'Don't you know you'll burn up?' The blonde says 'Well then I'll go at night.'

A beautiful blonde lady stepped onto a plane going to L.A. and sat down in first class. The flight attendant proceeded to go around the airplane checking the ticket stubs of each passenger to make sure they were all in the right seats. When she got to the Blonde woman she noticed that it was for Coach seating, not first class. She tells the woman, 'You're ticket says coach maam and we have a full flight today. I'm going to have to ask you to move.' To which the blonde replies, 'You don't understand, I'm blonde, beautiful, I'm going to L.A. and I'm getting there in first class.' Confused, the stewardess gets her supervisor. Again, she tells the woman that she must move. Again, the blonde replies, 'You don't understand, I'm blonde, beautiful, I'm going to L.A. and I'm getting there in first class.' Also confused, they go get the captain. He tells the woman that she must move. The blonde starts to say, 'You don't understand, I'm blonde, beautiful...' when he interrupts and asks, 'Can I whisper something in your ear?' 'Sure' she replies and he proceeds to whisper something in her ear. Suddenly she gets up and goes back to coach seating with a look of surprise on her face. The flight attendants are startled. 'How did you get her to move?' 'I told her that first class wasn't going to L.A.'

A blonde walks into a doctor's office. She gets in the room with the doctor and says, 'Doc, I hurt all over.' The doctor is really confused. He says, 'What do you mean, you hurt all over?' The blonde says, 'I'll show you.'

She then touches herself on her leg. 'OW!!! I hurt there.' Then she touches her earlobe. 'OW!!!!!! I hurt there too!' Then she touches her hair. 'OW!!!!! EVEN MY HAIR HURTS!' So the doctor sits back and thinks on it for 5 min. Then he says, 'Tell me, is blonde your natural hair color?' The blonde says 'Yes, why?'

The doctor says, 'Well, you got a broken finger...'

A young ventriloquist is touring the clubs and stops to entertain at a bar in a small town.

He's going through his usual run of stupid blonde jokes, when a large, blonde woman in the fourth row stands on her chair and says, 'I've heard just about enough of your denigrating blond jokes! What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What does a person's physical attributes have to do with their worth as a human being?' The ventriloquist looks on in amazement.

'It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in my community,' she continued,
'and of reaching my full potential as a person because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes but women at large... all in the name of humor.'

Flustered, the ventriloquist begins to apologize. The blonde interjects, 'You stay out of this, mister, I'm talking to that little bastard on your knee!'

A man is driving along a highway and sees a rabbit jump out across the middle of the road. He swerves to avoid hitting it, but unfortunately the rabbit jumps right in front of the car. The driver, a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulls over and gets out to see what has become of the rabbit. Much to his dismay, the rabbit is dead. The driver feels so awful that he begins to cry.

A beautiful blonde woman driving down the highway sees a man crying on the side of a road and pulls over. She steps out of the car and asks man what's wrong. 'I feel terrible,' he explains, 'I accidentally hit this rabbit and killed it.'

The blonde says, 'Don't worry.' She runs to her car and pulls out a spray can. She walks over to the limp, dead rabbit, bends down, and sprays the contents onto the rabbit. The rabbit jumps up, waves its paw at the two of
them and hops off down the road. Ten feet away the rabbit stops, turns around and waves again, he hops down the road another 10 feet, turns and waves, hops another ten feet, turns and waves, and repeats this again and
again and again, until he hops out of sight.

The man is astonished. He runs over to the woman and demands, 'What is in that can? What did you spray on that rabbit?' The woman turns the can around so that the man can read the label. It says, 'Hair Spray - Restores life to dead hair, adds permanent wave.'
