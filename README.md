Patriotic Parrot

Yesterday, I walked into a pet store.  When I walked to the back of the store, I saw an interesting parrot.  The parrot had a ribbon on either foot.  There was a red ribbon on his left foot, and a blue ribbon on his right foot.

As I was wondering what the ribbons were for, the store owner walked up to me.  He told me that if I pulled the red ribbon, the parrot would sing the 'Star Spangled Banner,' and the parrot did.  He then told me that if you pulled the blue ribbon, the parrot would sing, 'God Bless America,' and it did.

Interested, I asked the store owner, 'What will it do when I pull both ribbons at the same time?' The parrot then yelled, 'I'll fall off my perch, stupid!!!'
