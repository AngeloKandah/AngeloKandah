Redneck Hotel

A redneck couple had lived together in the backwoods for over fifty years. To celebrate their fiftieth anniversary, the man took her to a large city and they checked into a plush hotel.

The woman said to the bellman, 'We refuse to settle for such a small room. No windows, no bed, and no air conditioning.'

'But, madam,' replied the bellman.

'Don't 'But madam' me,' she continued. 'You can't treat us like we're a couple of fools just because we don't travel much, and we've never been to the big city, and never spent the night at a hotel. I'm going to complain to the manager.'

'Madam,' the bellman said, 'this isn't your room; this is the elevator!'
