Mr. L's Funny Story.

Hello, I am Mr. L, as most people call me. I am going to tell you a story that happened to me years ago.

Here goes!

People were pouring pollution all around they world; strangely, it made certain animals turn gigantic. That happened to a dog one day, it wasn't pretty. I don't know why, but it was chasing me around the city.

Eventually, I gave up and let it do what it wanted to do to me.

It came close to me, lifted its leg and...

I think I know why I it did what it did. I was wearing a shirt with a fire hydrant on it, and all the other ones were broken.

That's my story.
