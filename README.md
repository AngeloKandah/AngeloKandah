A beautiful blonde goes into a bar and sits down next to a guy that's so homely looking, he hasn't had a date in over a year, also, he's sooooo dumb that one night he slept with a ruler next to his head to see how long he slept.

He figures that he has absolutely no chance in the world to score a date with this ravishing buxom blonde, when suddenly she 
strikes up a conversation with him!  Soon they become rather chummy. It starts to get late and the bartender calls out last drink for alcohol.  The blonde leans over to the guy and says,
'Let's have this last drink at my apartment.'

Taken back by her request, and trembling, the guy finally utters
the word, 'Okay.'

They get up from the bar stool arm and arm headed for the door.  The blonde stops him and says, 'Before we go back to my apartment there's one thing I have to tell you, I'm on my menstrual cycle.'

He says, ...'That's ok, I'll follow you in my Honda.'
