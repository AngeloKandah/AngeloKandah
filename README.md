Not Emo

Chris and his friend Johnathan are standing outside of school one day. Johnathan finds Chris wearing his hair black and slicked down, with a purple stripe, with mascara and nail polish and a Korn t-shirt.

Johnathan: So, Chris, what's with the new outfit?

Chris: I'm Emo.

Johnathan: You are not Emo.

Chris: Yeah I am, my life has no meaning and I listen to Korn; I'm extremely Emo. 

Johnathan: Did you watch Family Guy last night?

Chris: Yeah.

Johnathan: ...

Chris: ...OH! Guess I'm not Emo.

Johnathan: Yup.

Chris: Can I still listen to Korn?

Johnathan: Sure.
