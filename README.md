The Ring

My husband, being unhappy with my mood swings, bought me a mood ring the other day so he would be able to monitor my moods.

We've discovered that when I'm in a good mood it turns green.

But when I'm in a bad mood it leaves a big red mark on his forehead.

Maybe next time the cheap bastard will buy me a diamond!
