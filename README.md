Three Guys and Awards

There were three guys at an award ceremony for their school: a not-so-smart one, an average one, and a smart one. 

The not-so-smart one proudly boasts, 'I'm going to receive an award today!'

The average one was a bit skeptical about this and asks, 'What kind of award will that be?'

Before the not-so-smart on was able to reply, the smart one said, 'The Most Improved Award.'
