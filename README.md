Heart Attack

A guy gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom.  He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed, sweating and panting. 
'What's up?' he asks. 

'I'm having a heart attack!' cries the woman. 

He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he is dialing, his 4-year old son comes up and says, 'Daddy! Daddy! Uncle Ted's  hiding in your wardrobe and he's got no clothes on!' 

The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife, and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure enough, there is his  brother, totally naked, cowering on the wardrobe floor. 

''You bastard,' says the husband. 'My wife is having a heart attack and you're running around with no clothes on scaring the kids!'
