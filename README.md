Little Willies

Willie was quite a boy to have round the house.

Willie, at a passing gent,
Threw a batch of fresh cement,
Crying, 'Wait until you dry.
Then you'll be a real hard guy.'

*****

Little Willie, home from school,
Where he'd learned the Golden Rule,
Said, 'If I eat all this cake,
Sis won't have a stomach-ache.'

*****

Little Willie on his bike,
Through the village took a hike.
Mrs. Thompson blocked the walk.
She will live, but still can't talk.

*****

Little Willie lit a rocket,
Which his dad had in his pocket,
Next day he told Cousin Dan,
'Daddy is a traveling man.'

*****

Little Willie in the best of sashes,
Fell in the fire and was burned to ashes.
By and by the room grew chilly,
But no one liked to poke up Willie.

*****

Willie, hitting at a ball,
Lined one down the school-house hall.
Through his door came Dr. Hill;
Several teeth are missing still.

*****

Little Willie from the mirror,
Sucked the mercury off,
Thinking in his childish error,
It would cure the whooping cough.
At the funeral his weeping mother,
Smartly said to Mrs. Brown,
' 'Twas a chilly day for Willie
When the mercury went down.'
