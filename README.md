Relieving Stress in Class

1. Leave permanent markers by the dry-erase board.
2. Ask whether the first chapter will be on the test. If the professor says no, rip the pages out of your textbook.
3. Hold up a piece of paper that says in large letters 'CHECK YOUR FLY'. (At Least for the Male profs.)
4. Address the professor as 'your excellency'.
5. When the professor turns on his laser pointer, scream 'AAAGH! MY EYES!'
6. Relive your Junior High days by leaving chalk stuffed in the chalkboard erasers.
7. Sit in the front, sniff suspiciously, and ask the professor if he's been drinking.
8. Correct the professor at least ten times on the pronunciation of your name, even it's Smith. Claim that the i is silent.
9. Sit in the front row reading the professor's graduate thesis and snickering.
10. Feign an unintelligible accent and repeatedly ask, 'Vet ozzle haffen dee henvay?' Become agitated when the professor can't understand you.
11. Wink at the professor every few minutes. (Hey you might even get a date if he/she is cute.)
12. Every few minutes, take a sheet of notebook paper, write 'Signup Sheet #5' at the top, and start passing it around the room.
13. Repeat number 12, except for write the names of random students in the class at the top first.  It will confuse them when they see it.
14. Start a 'wave' in a large lecture hall.
