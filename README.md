The Shot in the Head

The Vice President and his best friends were out hunting 
birds. People in the office knew that the best friend had 
some dirt on the vice president. When the vice president 
came back from hunting, the guy that owned the hunting place asked, 'Where's your friend?' The Vice President started to shake and said, 'Oh he's still hunting. I have my animals in this gym bag here.' 'O.k.' 
A week later he came back alone. Then when he got to the car the next day a police man was writing a parking ticket. The officer said, 'Sorry, sir, but I have to write you a ticket,' and glanced at his police partner in his police car. Then the Vice President said, 'Ok, let me just unlock the car and I'll be on my way.' Then when he clicked the trunk opener by accident, the trunk popped, and there was his best friend dead in the trunk and he said, 'Oops ...'

This shows how stupid some politicans can be.
