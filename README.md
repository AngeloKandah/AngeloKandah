The Exam

I went into my proctologist's office for my first rectal exam. His new nurse, Elaine, took me to an examining room and told me to get undressed and have a seat until the doctor could see me. She said that he would only be a few minutes. 

After putting on the gown that she gave me I sat down. While waiting I observed that there were three items on a stand next to the exam table: a tube of K-Y jelly, a rubber glove, and a beer. 

When the doctor finally came in I said, 'Look Doc, I'm a little confused. This is my first exam. I know what the K-Y is for, and I know what the glove is for, but can you tell me what the BEER is for?' At that Doctor Paul became noticeably outraged and stormed over to the door. He flung the door open and yelled to his nurse....... 

'Darn it ELAINE!!!!!!!!!!! I said a BUTT LIGHT'
