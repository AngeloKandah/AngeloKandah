The Perfect Pet

A man goes into a pet shop and tells the owner that he wants to buy a pet that can do everything.

The owner says, 'How about a dog?'

The man replies, 'A dog? That's so ordinary! And a dog can't do everything!'

The owner says, 'How about a cat?'

The man replies, 'No way! A cat certainly can't do everything. I want a pet that can do everything!'

The owner thinks for a minute, then says, 'I've got it -- a centipede!' The man says, 'A centipede? I can't imagine a centipede doing everything. But, okay ... I'll try a centipede.'

He gets the centipede home and says to it, 'Clean the kitchen.' Thirty minutes later, he walks into the kitchen and it's immaculate. All the dishes and silverware have been washed, polished, dried and put away. The countertops have been cleaned. The appliances are sparkling. The floor has been waxed.

He's absolutely amazed. He says to the centipede, 'Run down to the corner and get me a newspaper.' The centipede walks out the door. Ten minutes later, no centipede. Twenty minutes later, no centipede. Thirty minutes later, no centipede.

The man is wondering what's going on. The centipede should have been back in a couple of minutes. Forty-five minutes later, still no centipede! The man can't imagine what happened. Did the centipede run away? Did it get run over by a car? Finally, he goes to the front door and opens it... and there's the centipede sitting right outside the door.

The man says, 'Hey! I sent you 45 minutes ago to run down to the corner and get me a newspaper. What's the story?'

The centipede says, 'I'm goin'! I'm goin'! Just putting on my shoes!'
