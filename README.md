Oops!  Sorry, Mom!

One night, a man and his wife decide to go out on a date. They get all dolled up, call the cab, and put the cat out. When the cab arives, they head out the door just as the cat darts back inside. 

The man head backs in to chase out the cat, and his wife heads to the cab. Not wanting to let on that no one would be home that night, she explains to the driver, 'He's just going back in to say good-night to my mother.'

In a few minutes, the man returns to explain, 'Sorry it took me so long. The old thing was hiding under the bed and I had to poke her with a coat hanger to get her to come out!'
