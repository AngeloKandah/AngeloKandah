Buckwheat TITLE Darla

All the little rascals sat down for class, and the teacher decided to start off the day with a spelling quiz.

The teacher first asked Darla, 'Darla, can you spell dumb?'

'D-u-m-b,' said Darla

The teacher then said, 'Can you use it in a sentence?'

'Buckwheat is dumb.'

'Okay, can you spell stupid?' said the teacher.

'S-t-u-p-i-d.'

'Can you use it in a sentence?'

'Buckwheat is stupid.'

'Buckwheat, can you spell dictate?'

'D-i-c-t-a-t-e.'

'Can you use it in a sentence?'

'I may be dumb, and I may be stupid, but Darla says my dictate good.'
