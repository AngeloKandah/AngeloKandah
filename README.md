Hecho En Mexico

A woman goes for her pelvic exam. While the doctor is doing the exam, he notices bikini tan lines, and she has sandals on that say 'hecho en mexico' (made in mexico). So he casually asks her, 'So did you enjoy your trip to Mexico?'
She sits up a little and stares at him with this look of disbelief. 'You can tell that just from a pelvic exam?!?!?'
