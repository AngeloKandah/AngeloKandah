This is an actual chatroom conversation from a 'local Chatroom'

Joe: I wonder what would happen if you had a sleep number bed,       and set it to 69?

Christy: ? huh?

Mike: I dont know, but it sure sounds tasty!

Joe: You probably wouldn't understand Christy, you're too pure and innocent.

Christy: Maybe... sounds more like a police code or something 

Mike: lol, ya, that's it. 'This is the dispatcher, what is your status'

Joe: lol 'We have a 69 in progress at the overpass, Officer needs assistance'

Mike: 'Move in! Move in! Officer has gone down, repeat, Officer has gone down!

Joe: 'Someone better call the fire department, looks like we'll need the Jaws of Life for this one!'

Christy: um.. why do i get the feeling i've started something horrible? o.O
