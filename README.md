Chair

The voluptuous blonde entered the dentist's office in an obvious state of agitation. She sat down in the chair and fidgeted nervously as the dentist prepared his utensils. 

'Oh, doctor,' she exclaimed, as he prepared to look into her mouth. 'I'm so afraid of dentists. Why, I think I'd rather have a baby than have a tooth drilled.' 

'Well, miss,' said the dentist impatiently, 'better make up your mind before I adjust the chair.'
