But....he Made His Own Lunch!!

Once there were 3 guys, a Cuban, an American, and an Italian. So they worked together,and it was lunch time, so the American opens his lunch box and sees peanut-butter and jelly sandwich and he says, 'If I get a peanut-butter jelly sandwich one more time I'm going to kill myself.'
Then the Italian opens his lunch box and sees spaghetti and he says, 'If I get spaghetti one more time I'm going to kill myself.'
Lastly, the Cuban opens his lunch and sees black beans and he says, 'If I get black beans one more time, I'm going to to do the same.

The next day the all open their lunch boxes, and the Cuban  sees black beans again, so he kills himself, then the Italian sees spaghetti again, so he kills himself also. Lastly, the American sees peanut-butter and jelly sandwich again so he kills himself too.

Then, at the funeral, their wifes are talking and the American wife says 'Oh..! he should at least told me about his lunch, that way he wouldn't have killed himself.'
Then the Italian wife agrees and says the same, and then the Cuban wife says, 'But I don't understand, he makes his own lunch!'
