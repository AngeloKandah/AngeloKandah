Gift Registry

Jacob, age 92, and Rebecca, age 89, are quite excited about their decision to get married. They go for a stroll to discuss the wedding and on the way they pass a drugstore. Jacob suggests they go in.

Jacob addresses the man behind the counter. 'Are you the owner?'

The pharmacist answers, 'Yes.'

Jacob: 'We're about to get married. Do you sell heart medication?'

Pharmacist: 'Of course we do.'

Jacob: 'How about medicine for circulation?'

Pharmacist: 'Many kinds.'

Jacob: 'Medicine for rheumatism, scoliosis?'

Pharmacies: 'Definitely.'

Jacob: 'How about Viagra?'

Pharmacist: Hesitates slightly but answers, 'Of course.'

Jacob: 'Medicine for memory problems, arthritis, jaundice?'

Pharmacist: 'Yes, a large variety.'

Jacob: 'What about vitamins, sleeping pills, Geritol, antidotes for Parkinson's?'

Pharmacist: 'Absolutely!'

Jacob: 'Do you sell wheelchairs and walkers?'

Pharmacist: 'All speeds and sizes.'

Jacob turns and confers with his wife to be and then says to the pharmacist,

'We'd like to register here for our wedding gifts.'
