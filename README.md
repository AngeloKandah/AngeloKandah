Entry Fee

A little girl and her father decided to go to church, because her father wanted to introduce her to the Christian World. As they sat down, a collection plate begins to be passed around. As the plate came to the girl's father, he searches his pockets for money. Then his daughter whispers in his ear, 'Don't worry Daddy, I'm already free and covered.... I'm under 5.'
