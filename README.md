Chicken Vs. Possum

One beautiful morning, a husband and wife decided to go for a drive in the country. Unfortunately, no matter which road they took, they kept seeing dead possums lying on the shoulder.

After several miles of this, the husband turned to his wife and said, 'Now I think I know the answer to the age-old question 'Why did the chicken cross the road?''

'What is it?' she asked.

'Well,' he replied, 'it was to prove to the possums that it could be done.'
