Jesus Christ!

The preschoolers' Sunday school teacher told them that she wanted each of them to learn one fact about Jesus by the following Sunday. The next Sunday, she asked each of them what they had learned.

'I learned that he was born in a manger,' said Julie.

Timmy said, 'I learned that he threw the money changers out of the temple.'

'What about you, Johnny? What did you learn?' the teacher asked.

'He has a pick-up truck and he doesn't know how to drive,' replied Little Johnny.

Curious, the teacher asked, 'And where did you learn that, Johnny?'

'I learned it from Daddy,' Little Johnny explained. 'When we were driving down the highway, a pick-up truck cut right in front of us and Daddy shouted, 'Jesus Christ! Why don't you learn how to drive!'
