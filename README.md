Little Leroy was at Home...

Little Leroy was at home doing his math homework. He said to himself, 'Two plus five, that son of a bitch is seven. Three plus six, that son of a bitch is nine.' At that moment, his mother came in and heard that he was cursing. 'Leroy, what are you doing?! Why are you saying that?' 

Little Leroy answered, 'I'm doing my math homework, Mom.' 

She said, 'And is that what  your teacher taught you?' 

He replied, 'Yes.'  

The next day, the mother, worried about the education her son is receiving, goes to Little Leroy's school to talk to the teacher. The mother said to his Math teacher, 'I would like to know what you are teaching my son in math.' The teacher replied, 'Right now, we are learning addition problems.' Little Leroy's mother asked, 'Are you teaching them to say two plus two, that son of a bitch is four?' 

When the teacher stopped laughing she replied, 'Not at all! What I taught them was two plus two, THE SUM OF WHICH IS four.'
