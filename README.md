Getting a Job

A brunette, a redhead and a blonde all apply for the same job. The manager says, 'I can only hire one of you so I'm going to ask you each a question and whoever answers it correctly gets the job.' He takes the brunette into the room and asks her, 'How many D's in Indiana Jones?' She replies, 'One.'

He brings the redhead into the room and asks her the same question. She thinks for a moment and says, 'One.'

He then brings the blonde into the room and asks her the same question; 'How many D's in Indiana Jones?'

She thinks for a little. She counts on her fingers, counts on her toes, wiggles her ears, sticks out her tongue and finally comes up with, 'Thirty Six.'

The rest of them ask her, 'How the hell did you come up with thirty six?!'

She replies with a smile on her face, 'Da da da da, da da da.' (Sing the Indiana Jones theme song)
