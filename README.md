Tommy Tomcat

Tired of having to stare at the luscious young kitten on the other side of the chain link fence, bold Tommy Tomcat decided to visit her one day. Settling back on his haunches, he gave a mighty leap and landed on the other side; impressed, the lovely cat sauntered over. 

'That was quite a leap,' she remarked. 'Want to go somewhere and cuddle?' 

'Afraid not,' said Tommy, a pained expressions on his face. 'The fence was higher than I thought.'
