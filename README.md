How Can You Tell If You're One of Life's Losers?...

You don't have any luck at all if:

-The guarantee on your used car expires two hours before the car's engine does.

- You start to go bald at the same time you reach puberty.

-You get your BIG break and make the football team only to trip over the bench and break your leg.

-You find a ten-dollar bill and get arrested when you try to spend it because it's counterfeit.
