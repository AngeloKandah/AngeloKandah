Water in Singapore

The running water in Singapore can be drunk directly. So when I get thirsty, I go to the toilet and drink. But how to make a bowl of instant noodle? A girl thinks:
'Since the running water can be drunk directly, the water from electric bathing machine also can!'
So she use the water from bathing machine to make instant noodle.
