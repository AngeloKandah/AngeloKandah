A Lawer in a Ambulance!

Bob and Joe, a couple of personal injury lawyers, were discussing conditions in the legal profession. 'How's business?' asked Bob. 
'Absolutely rotten!' responded Joe. 'How have you been doing?' 'Even worse,' Bob replied. 'I just chased an ambulance twelve miles and found a LAWYER inside it.'
