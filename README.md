Win a ...

This blonde goes into a restaurant and notices there's a 'peel and win' sticker on her coffee cup. So, she peels it off and starts screaming, 'I've won a motor home! I've won a motor home!'

The waitress says, 'That's impossible. The biggest prize is a mini-van.'

But the blonde keeps screaming, 'I've won a motor home!  I've won a motor home.'

Finally, the manager comes over and says, 'Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you're mistaken. You couldn't possibly have won a motor home, because we didn't have that as a prize!'

The blonde says, 'No, it's not a mistake. I've won a motor home!'

So, she hands the ticket to the manager and he reads, 'WIN A BAGEL'.
