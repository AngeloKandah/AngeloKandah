Sergeant Rosenbloom

During World War II, a sergeant gets a telephone call from a woman. 'We would love it,' she said, 'if you could bring five of your soldiers over to our house for Thanksgiving dinner.'
'Certainly, ma'am,' replied the sergeant.
'Oh... just make sure they aren't Jews, of course,' said the woman.
'Will do,' replied the sergeant. So that Thanksgiving while the woman is baking, the doorbell rings. She opens her door and, to her horror, five black soldiers are standing in front of her.
'Oh, my!' she exclaimed. 'I'm afraid there's been a terrible mistake!'
'No ma'am,' said one of the soldiers. 'Sergeant Rosenbloom never makes mistakes!'
