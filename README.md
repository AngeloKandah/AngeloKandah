There I was, in my car, driving down the road, when my boss rang up and said, 'We're making you Chief Area Salesman,' and I swerved.
Ten minutes later, he called again, 'You're now Deputy Area Manager,' and I swerved again.
Another twenty minutes go by, and another phone call, 'You're now Vice Chairman,' and I swerved right off the road into a ditch.
When the police asked what had happened, I said, 'I just careered off the road.'
