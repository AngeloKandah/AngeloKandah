Assertive Husband

A man was tired of being bossed around by his wife, so he went to see a psychiatrist. 

The psychiatrist said he needed to build his self-esteem and so gave him a book on assertiveness, which he read on the way home. He finished the book by the time he reached his house. 

The man stormed into the house and walked up to his wife. 

Pointing a finger in her face, he said, 'From now on, I want you to know that - I - am the man of this house, and my word is law! 

'I want you to prepare me a gourmet meal tonight, and when I'm finished eating my meal, I expect a sumptuous dessert afterward. 

'Then, after dinner, you're going to draw me my bath so I can relax. And, when I'm finished with my bath, guess who's going to dress me and comb my hair?' 

His wife replied, 'The funeral director.'
