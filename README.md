The Tollbooth

The driver of a huge trailer lost control of his rig, plowed into an empty tollbooth and smashed it to pieces. He climbed down from the wreckage and within a matter of minutes, a truck pulled up and discharged a crew of workers.
The men picked up each broken piece of the former tollbooth and spread some kind of creamy substance on it. Then they began fitting the pieces together. In less than a half hour, they had the entire tollbooth reconstructed and looking good as new.

'Astonishing!' the truck driver said to the crew chief. 'What was the white stuff you used to get all the pieces together?'

The crew chief said, 'Oh, that was tollgate booth paste.'
