The Castle

A group of American tourists were on a guided tour through an ancient castle in Europe.

'Ladies and gentlemen,' the guide said, 'this castle is over 700 years old. Nothing has been altered or touched in all those years.'

'Sounds like they have the same cheap landlord I have!' exclaimed one of the tourists.
