A bank robber in Virginia Beach got a nasty surprise when a dye pack designed to mark stolen money exploded in his Fruit-of-the-Looms. The robber apparently stuffed the loot down the front of his pants as he was running out the door. 'He was seen hopping and jumping around,' said police spokesman Mike Carey, 'with an explosion taking place inside his pants.' 
Police have the man's charred trousers in custody...
