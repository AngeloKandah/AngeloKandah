Whats that smell?

Have you ever asked your child a question too many times? Johnny a three-year-old had a lot of problems with potty training and his mother was with him constantly. One day they stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch in between errands. It was very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying her  taco, the mother smelled something funny, so of course she checked her seven-month-old daughter and she was clean. Then Mom realized that Johnny had not asked to go potty in a while, so she asked him if he needed to go, and he said 'No.' She kept thinking, 'Oh Lord, that child has had an accident, and I don't have any clothes with me.' Then she said, 'Johnny, are you SURE you didn't have an accident?' 'No,' he replied. she just KNEW that he must have had an accident, because the smell was getting worse. Soooooo! she asked one more time, 'Johnny, did you have an accident?' This time he jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread his cheeks and yelled. 'SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!!' While 30 people nearly choked to death on their tacos laughing, he calmly pulled up his pants and sat down.
