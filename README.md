UVA

A young West Virginian girl wanted to go to college at UVA. But her father said 'No way! You're going to By-God West Virginia Univ.' 

Well, she got her way and she went to UVA. The first semester went by, and she wrote home that she was getting married, to a man from Richmond, VA named Clarence. Her father said 'I'll be damned if my daughter is marrying a man from Richmond, you're marrying a By-God West Virginian boy,' so he sent his two sons to UVA to get their sister. 

In a couple of days they returned. The confused father asked 'Where is your sister?' 
They replied 'We were almost there Dad, but we got to this overpass with a sign that said 'Clarence 13'6'' so we turned around and drove the hell out of there!'
