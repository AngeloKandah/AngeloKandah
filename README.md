Hotel Clerk

After a heavy night at the pub, a drunken man decides to sleep off his drunkenness at a local hotel. He approaches the reception desk, takes care of the formalities and heads off to his suite. Several minutes later, the drunk staggers back to the reception desk and demands his room be changed. 'But sir,' said the clerk, 'you have the best room in the hotel.' 'I insist on another room!!!' said the drunk. 'Very good, sir. I'll change you from 502 to 525. Would you mind telling me why you don't like 502?' asked the clerk. 'Well, for one thing,' said the drunk, 'it's on fire.'
