Scotch Expert

A guy walks into a bar and rudely demands a shot of 12-yr old scotch. 
The bartender thinks, 'This guy doesn't know the difference,' so he pours a shot of 2-year old scotch. 
The patron takes one sip and spits it out. He promptly hollers at the bartender, 'I said 12-year old scotch, you bozo!' 
Still unimpressed, the bartender pours some 6-year old scotch. 
The patron takes a sip...same reaction. 
But the bartender still doesn't believe the patron knows the difference. So he pours a shot of 10-year old scotch. Again, same reaction from the patron. 
Finally, the bartender is convinced. He pours the patron a glass of 12-year-old scotch. The patron takes a sip and is most satisfied. 
All the while this has been going on, a drunk at the end of the bar has been watching. 
He slides a shot glass down the bar to the patron and drunkedly says: 'Shay mishter, tashte this!' The patron obliges...he promptly spits it out. 
'That tastes like pee!' he shoots back at the drunk. 
The drunk replies: 'It ish. Now how old am I?'
