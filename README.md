Reducing Salon

A tearful woman phoned a reducing salon to wail that her husband had just given her a lovely present and she couldn't get into it.  The operator gave her an appointment and added, 'Don't worry, madam, we'll have you wearing that dress in no time.'

'Dress?' the matron sobbed.  'It's a Porsche!'
