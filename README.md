The Girl at the Restaurant

Once there was a girl at a restaurant and ordered anything in a saucer. The waiter was walking to her table when the girl tripped him. The waiter said 'Why did you trip me?' 
And the girl, without the least of the waiter's worries simply said 'I wanted to see a flying saucer!'
