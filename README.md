50th Anniversery

With a man soon to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary at the church's marriage marathon, the minister asked Pete to take a few minutes and share some insight into how he managed to maintain his marriage with the same woman all these years.

The husband replied to the audience, 'Well, I treated her with respect, spent money on her, but mostly I took her traveling on special occasions.'
The minister inquired 'Trips to where?'
'For our 25th anniversary, I took her to Beijing, China.'
The minister then said, 'What a terrific example you are to all husbands, Pete. Please tell the audience what you're going to do for your wife on your 50th anniversary.'

Pete: 'I'm going back to go get her.'
