NUTS

While on the obstacle course in bootcamp, we had to lay on a rope and pull ourselves along.
When I got to the other end and got my feet on the ground I asked my M/CPL if I could do that again.
When he asked me why, I retorted with, 'Well I have a groove down my left nut, I would like to put a groove down my right nut so they would match up again.'
