Nobody Slept With Mom

Ever notice how a 4 year olds voice is louder than 200 adult voices? 

Several years ago, I returned home from a trip just 
when a storm hit, with crashing thunder and severe lightning. As I came into my bedroom about 2 a.m., I found my two children in bed with my wife, Karen, apparently scared by the loud storm. I resigned myself to sleeping in the guest bedroom that night.

The next day, I talked to the children, and explained that it was o.k. to sleep with Mom when the storm was bad, but when I was expected home, please don't sleep with Mom that night. 
They said o.k..

After my next trip several weeks later, Karen and the children picked me up in the terminal at the appointed time. Since the plane was late, everyone had come into the terminal to wait for my plane's arrival, along with hundreds of other folks 
waiting for their arriving passengers.

As I entered the waiting area, my son saw me, and came running shouting, 'Hi, Dad! I've got some good news!'

As I waved back, I said loudly, 'What is the good news?'

'The good news is that nobody slept with Mommy while you were away this time!' Alex shouted.

The airport became very quiet, as everyone in the waiting area looked at Alex, then turned to me, and then searched the rest of the area to see if they could figure out exactly who his Mom was.
