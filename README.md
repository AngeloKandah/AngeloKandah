Hey FART

There was a lady that had a 3 year old son and one was coming on the way (she was pregnant). When the 3 year old asked his mother why her stomach was so big, she told him that it was just gas (she didn't want to give him a confusing explanation).
The day that the baby was born, the 3 year old came up to the baby and said, 'Hey, Fart!'
