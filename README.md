Sick Blonde

A blonde came home from her first day commuting into the city. 
Her mother noticed she was looking a little peaked and asked, 'Honey, are you feeling all right?'

'Not really,' the blonde replied. 'I'm nauseous from sitting backward on the train.'

'Poor dear,' Mom said. 'Why didn't you ask the person sitting across from you to switch seats for a while?'

'I couldn't,' she replied, 'there was no one there.'
