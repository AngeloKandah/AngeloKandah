Goose Meat

What was the most-frequently used word at the German-German border? 'Goose meat'. (GÃ¤nsefleisch, sounds like the first three words in Genn' se vleisch mal 'n Gofferraum offmachn? in the Saxon accent, KÃ¶nnen Sie vielleicht mal den Kofferraum aufmachen? in standard German, which means Could you please open the trunk? )
