Going To The Lake

One afternoon, Tommy is driving down a highway to spend some time at a lake and relax. On his way to the lake, he spots a guy dressed from head to toe in red standing on the side of the highway, gesturing for him to stop.
He rolls down his window and asks, 'How can I help you?'

'I'm the red jerk of the highway. You got something to eat?' the guy in red says.

Smiling, Tommy hands the guy a sandwich and drives away. A few short minutes later, he comes across another guy. This guy is dressed completely in yellow, and he's standing on the side, motioning for him to stop.

Slightly annoyed, he stops, rolls down the window, and says, 'What can I do for you?'

'I'm the yellow jerk of the highway. You got something to drink?' the guy in yellow asks.

Barely managing a smile, Tommy hands the guy a can of soda and takes off again. Wanting to reach the lake before sunset, he decides to go faster and not stop, no matter what.

Much to his frustration, he sees another guy on the side of the road. This guy is dressed in blue and is signaling for him to stop. Reluctantly, he stops one last time, rolls down his window, and screams, 'Let me guess. You must be the blue jerk of the highway. Just what the hell do you wanna have?'

'Driver's license and registration, please!'
