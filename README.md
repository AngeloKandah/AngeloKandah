The Wedding

A mother and her child were at a wedding.

A little boy looks at his mom and says, 'Mommy, why does the girl wear white?'

His mom replies, 'The bride is in white because she's happy and this is the happiest day of her life.'

The boy thinks about this, and then says, 'Well then, why is the boy wearing black?'
