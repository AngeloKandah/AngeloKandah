Up For Grabs

Three ministers are talking over lunch and before long find themselves discussing how much of the weekly offering is appropriate to keep and how much to give to the Lord.

The first minister says, 'I just draw a line on the floor, put one foot on each side, and throw the money into the air. Whatever lands on the right side of the line is God's and whatever lands on the left is mine.' 

The second minister notes that he uses a similar method, but 'I use a small coffee table when I throw the money in the air and whatever lands on the table goes to the Lord and whatever lands on the floor is mine.'

They both contemplate each other's answer and finally turn to the third minister who is sitting there without saying anything. 'Well, how do you do it?' asks the first to the third. 

'Well, I do as you both do and throw the money into the air, but I figure whatever the Lord wants, he'll grab, and I keep whatever hits the floor.'
