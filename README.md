Unruly Child

A man scolded his son for being so unruly and the child rebelled against his father. He got some of his clothes, his teddy bear and his piggy bank and proudly announced, 'I'm running away from home!' 

The father calmly decided to look at the matter logically. 'What if you get hungry?' he said. 

'Then I'll come home and eat!' bravely declared the child. 'And what if you run out of money?' 

'I will come home and get some!' readily replied the child. 

The man then made a final attempt, 'What if your clothes get dirty?' 

'Then I'll come home and let mommy wash them,' was the reply. 

The man shook his head and exclaimed, 'This kid is not running away from home, he's going off to college!'
