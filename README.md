Collection of 'You Know You're a Redneck When...' Number 2

Managed to remember some MORE Redneck lines while hearing a couple more.

You know you're a redneck when:

You lost your virginity at the age of 11.

You need an estimate from your barber before you get a haircut.

Taking a dip has nothing to do with water.

There are more than ten lawsuits currently pending against your dog.

You take a fishing pole to Sea World.

The hood and one door are a different color from the rest of your car.

Your TV is a bag of manure on fire.

Your 'family reunion' was at the NRA convention.

Santa Claus refuses to let your kids sit in his lap.

You've shot somebody over a mall parking space.

Your toilet paper has page numbers on it.

Making a chocolate cake has nothing to do with chocolate.

You think the O.J. trial was the big Sunkist and Minutemaid 
taste test.
