Hell on Friday

One day, John dies and finds himself in hell. As he is wallowing in despair, he meets the demon. 

Demon: 'Why so sad, my friend?'

John:    'What do you think? I'm in hell!'

Demon: 'Hell's not so bad. We actually have a lot of fun down here. You a drinkin' man?'

John:    'Sure, I love to drink.'

Demon: 'Well, you're gonna love Mondays then. On Mondays, that's all we do, is drink. Whiskey, tequila, vodka, beer...We drink till we throw up and then drink some more.'

John:  'Gee, that sounds great!'

Demon: 'You a smoker?'

John:    'You better believe it.'

Demon: 'Allright! You're gonna love Tuesday. We get the finest cigars from around the world and smoke our lungs out. If you get cancer, it's ok, you're already dead!'

John:    'Golly'

Demon: 'I bet you like to gamble.'

John:    'Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.'

Demon: 'Good, because Wednesday is gambling day. Craps, blackjack, horse races, you name it.'

John:    'Wow!'

Demon: 'You like to use drugs?'

John:    'Well, I love to use drugs. You don't mean...' 

Demon: 'That's right! Thursday is drug day. Help yourself to a great big bowl of crack. Smoke a doobie the size of a submarine. You can use all the drugs you want, and if you overdose, it's ok... You're already dead!' 

John:    'Neat! I never realized hell was such a swingin' place!'

Demon: 'You gay?'

John:    'Uhhhhh, no!!'

Demon: 'Ohhhh.... you're gonna hate Fridays....'
