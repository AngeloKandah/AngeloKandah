Trying to Fix a Clock

Harvey's grandfather clock suddenly stops working right one day, so he loads it into his van and takes it to a clock repair shop. 

In the shop is a little old man who insists he is Swiss, and has a heavy German accent. He asks Harvey, 'Vat sims to be ze problem?' 

Harvey says, 'I'm not sure, but it doesn't go 'tick-tocktick -tock' anymore. Now it just goes 'tick...tick...tick.'' 

The old man says, 'Mmm-Hm!' and steps behind the counter, where he rummages around a bit. He emerges with a huge flashlight and walks over the grandfather clock. 

He turns the flashlight on, and shines it directly into the clocks face. Then he says in a menacing voice, 'Ve haf vays of making you tock!'
