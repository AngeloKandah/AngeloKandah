The Meaning of Dreams

A woman awoke excitedly on Valentine's Day and announced enthusiastically to her husband, 'I just dreamt that you gave me a pearl necklace for Valentine's Day! What do you think it means?'

With certainty in his voice, the man said, 'You'll know tonight.'

That evening, the man came home with a small package and handed it to his wife. With anxious anticipation the woman quickly opened the package to find a book entitled, 'The Meaning of Dreams.'
