Little Girl

A little girl learned in school, that instead of words, pictures and symbols would be drawn to indicate something if words weren't understood.

Later that day, she needed to go into the bathroom, looked at two pictures, and went in one.  A teacher asked her, 'Why did you go into the boys' bathroom?'  She answered, 'The picture showed a person wearing pants, and I'm wearing pants.  The other picture showed someone wearing a dress, and I'm not.'
