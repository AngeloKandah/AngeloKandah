A Minister Decided to Do...

A minister decided to do something a little different one Sunday morning. He said 'Today, church members, I am going to say a single word and you are going to help me preach. Whatever single word I say, I want you to sing whatever hymn that comes to your mind.'

The pastor shouted out, 'Cross.' 
Immediately the congregation started singing in unison, 'The Old Rugged Cross.'

The Pastor hollered out 'Grace.' 
The congregation began to sing, 'Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound...'

The Pastor said, 'Power.' 
The congregation sang, 'There is Power in the Blood.'

The Pastor said, 'Sex.' 
The congregation fell in total silence; everyone was in shock. They all nervously began to look around at each other, afraid to say anything. Then, way in the back of the church, a little old grandmother stood up and began to sing,

.........'Precious Memories'.
