Who Would Have Been President?

Bill and Hillary were going down a back road and stopped at a gas station.

As the worker was filling up their car, he said to Hillary, 'I went to high school with you'. 

She recognized him and agreed with him.

Later, as they were driving down the road, Bill said, 'If you had married him you wouldn't be married to the President.'

Hillary said, 'Oh yes, I would - he would be President.'
