The Same Egg

Two farmers were boasting about the strongest wind they'd ever experienced. 'Out here in California,' said one, 'I've seen the fiercest wind in my life. You know those giant redwoods trees? Well the wind got so strong it bent them right over.'

'That's nothing,' said the farmer from Iowa. 'Back on my farm we had a wind one day that blew a hundred miles per hour. It was so bad that one of my hens had her back turned to the wind and laid the same egg six times!'
