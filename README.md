Confused Zebra

A zebra had died and when he got to Heaven he asked the guard, out of curiosity, if he was white with black strips or black with white strips.  The guard said that he would see God roaming around Heaven and the zebra could ask Him.  A couple weeks later he finally sees God and asks, 'Out of curiosity, am I white with black stripes or black with white strips.'  God answered, 'You are what your are.'  The zebra was puzzled, but went along anyway.  A few days later the zebra sees the guard again.  The guard said, 'So did you see God? What did he say?'  The zebra replied, 'Well, he said 'You are what are what your are.''  The guard  goes, 'Oh, then it means that you are white with black stripes.'  The zebra asked, 'How do you know?'  The guard answered, 'If you were black with white stripes, He would have said 'You is what you is'.'
