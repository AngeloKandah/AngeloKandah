Botty Burp

A man walked into the doctor's surgery and said, 'Doctor, every time I break wind it sounds like a motor bike.'
'That's very interesting; is there anything else bothering you?' asked the doctor.
'I also have a large boil on my backside,' said the man.
'Right,' said the doctor, 'I will lance your boil and your problem will disappear.'
'How's that?' asked the man.
'Because abscess makes the fart go Honda.'
