Naval Operations

The following is an actual radio conversation released by the Chief of Naval Operations: 

#1: Please divert your course 15 degrees to the north to avoid a collision. 

#2: Recommend you divert your course 15 degrees to south to avoid a collision. 

#1: This is the captain of a U. S. navy ship. I say again, divert YOUR course. 

#2: No. I say again, you divert YOUR course. 

#1. THIS IS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER ENTERPRISE. WE ARE A LARGE WARSHIP OF THE U. S. NAVY. DIVERT YOUR COURSE NOW! 

#2. This is a lighthouse. Your call.
