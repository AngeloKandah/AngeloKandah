Disclaimer: I do not condone these jokes, they are from a collection of jokes I found.

Tom, the Fisherman,...

Tom, the fisherman, wrote the following to a mail order catalogue, 'Please send me one of those gasoline engines for my boat you show on page 438, and if it's any good, I'll send you a check.'

A few days later, Tom received the following reply, 'Please send check. If it's any good, we'll send the engine.'
