Parent Meeting

A blonde, brunette, and a redhead all get together once a week to talk about the problems they are having with their daughters, and get input from the other two moms. So, the brunette decided to open the meeting. 
     'I found a pack of cigarettes on my daughter's nightstand the other night. What am I going to do?'
     The moms told her to talk to her daughter and tell her it was wrong, and to never do it again.
     The redhead said that she had recently found a 12 pack of beer in her daughter's closet. The moms told her to talk to her daughter, tell her it was wrong, and never to do it again. 
     When it was the blonde mom's turn she said:
     'I found a box of condoms on my daughter's dresser the other day.'
      All the moms are in shock. But the blonde gets up and says, 'No no, the worst part is that I didn't even know she had one of those.'
