A Working Dog

When the salesman dropped in to pay a visit to one of his customers, he found the office empty except for a very large dog who was emptying wastebaskets. Rubbing his eyes, he was certain they must have been playing tricks on him.

'Don't look so surprised,' said the dog, 'after all, this is part of my job.'

'This is amazing!' exclaimed the salesman. 'I can't believe it. Does you boss know what a prize he has in you? An animal that can actually talk!'

'No, no,' the dog pleaded, 'don't tell him. If he knows I can talk, the next thing you know he'll have me answering the phones too.'
