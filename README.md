Medieval Penguins

Sir Lancelot was losing patience with Lady Guinevere. He had fought battles; he had jeopardized his reputation; he had ruined his friendship with King Arthur.

But it was all worthwhile just to have this time with his lovely lady. They had run away for a little while, but Lancelot was growing angry because Guinevere was spending all her time on a stupid crossword puzzle.

When she raised her quill to write in another word, he snapped. He couldn't take it any more.

He yelled in a harsh tone, 'GIVE ME THE PEN GUIN!'

After that, she thought he had lost his mind, and left him.
