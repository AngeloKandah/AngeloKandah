For Mother Superior

A nun walks into a liquor store and asks to buy a fifth of whiskey. She says it's for Mother Superior's constipation, so the owner says ok. She buys the booze and leaves. Two hours later, the owner closes store and walks through the park on his way home. As he's walking, he spots the same nun sitting on a park bench, roaring drunk. 'Shame on you, Sister', he says, 'I thought that whiskey was for Mother Superior's constipation.' 'It is,' she slurrs. 'When she sees me, she'll crap!'
