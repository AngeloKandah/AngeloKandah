Mary Lou

One day a man was sitting in his favorite chair watching football when his wife walked up behind him and knocked him over the head with a frying pan.
When he woke he asked, 'What the hell was that for?!?'
'I found this piece of paper in your pants while I was doing your laundry and it says Mary Lou 555-5555. Who the hell is Mary Lou?!?' she asks.
'Aww honey, that's the name of the horse I was bettin' on last week!'
'Oh I'm so sorry honey!'


Three weeks later she came behind him and knocked him over the head with a frying pan and once again he woke up asking, 'What the hell did I do this time?!?'


'Your horse called,' she replied.
