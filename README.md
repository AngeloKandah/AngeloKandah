Winning The Nobel Prize!

A man is driving down a country road, when he spots a male farmer standing in the middle of a huge field of grass. Of course the farmer is a blond. :)

He pulls the car over to the  side of the road and notices that the farmer is just standing there, doing nothing, looking at nothing.

The man gets out of the car, walks all the way out to the farmer and asks him, 'Er... excuse me mister, but what are you doing?'

The farmer replies, 'I'm trying to win a Nobel Prize.'

'How?' asks the man, puzzled.

'Well, I heard they give the Nobel Prize to people who are out standing in their field!'
