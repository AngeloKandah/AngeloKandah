Redneck Party

Recently, my redneck neighbors invited me to a party. Here was our conversation:

'Hey dude! Where are you man? We're having a great party over here. Why don't you come on over and join us?'

I replied, 'Man, I'm not feeling so good. I think I'm gonna stay right here.'

'Well, hey. What'cha got?' they asked.

'I got a case of diarrhea,' I responded.

'Well heck, bring it along. These fools will drink anything!'
