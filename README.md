Three freshman engineering students were sitting around talking between classes, when one brought up the question of who designed the human body.

One of the students insisted that the human body must have been designed by an electrical engineer because of the perfection of the nerves and synapses.

Another disagreed, and exclaimed that it had to have been a mechanical engineer who designed the human body. The system of levers and pullies is ingenious.

'No,' the third student said. 'You're both wrong. The human body was designed by an architect. Who else but an architect would have put a toxic waste line through a recreation area?'
