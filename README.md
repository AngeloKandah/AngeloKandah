Ferry

This guy loved living in Staten Island, but he wasn't crazy about the ferry. If you missed a ferry late at night, you had to spend the next hour or so wandering the deserted streets of lower Manhattan. 

So, when he spotted a ferry no more than fifteen feet from the dock, he decided he wouldn't subject himself to an hour's wait. He made a running leap and landed on his hands and knees, a little bruised maybe, but safe on deck. 

He got up, brushed himself off, and announced proudly to a bystander, 'Well, I made that one, didn't I?' 

'Sure did,' the bystander said. 'But you should have waited a minute or two. The ferry is just about to dock.'
