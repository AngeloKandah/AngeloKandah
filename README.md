The Rabbi and the pious man

A Rabbi was walking home from the Temple and a pious and learned man who could usually beat the rabbi in religious arguments. The rabbi started walking faster so that he could catch up to his friend, when he was horrified to see his friend go into a Chinese restaurant (not a kosher one). Standing at the door, he observed his friend talking to a waiter and gesturing at a menu. A short time later, the waiter reappeared carrying a platter full of spare ribs, shrimp in lobster sauce, crab rangoon and other treif that the Rabbi could not bear to think about. As his friend picked up the chopsticks and began to eat this food, the Rabbi burst into the restaurant and reproached his friend, for he could take it no longer. 'Morris, what is this you are doing? I saw you come into this restaurant, order this filth and now you are eating it in violation of everything we are taught about the dietary laws and with an apparent enjoyment that does not befit your pious reputation!' 
Morris replied, 'Rabbi, did you see me enter this restaurant?' (Rabbi nods yes) 
'Did you see me order this meal?' (again he nods yes) 
'Did you see the waiter bring me this food?' (again he nods yes) 
'And did you see me eat it?' (nods yes) 
'Then, Rabbi, I don't see the problem here. The entire meal was done under Rabbinical supervision!'
