What Nationality Were Adam and Eve?

A Briton, a Frenchman and a Russian are viewing a painting of Adam and Eve frolicking in the Garden of Eden. 

'Look at their reserve, their calm,' muses the Brit. 'They must be British.' 

'Nonsense,' the Frenchman disagrees. 'They're naked, and so beautiful. Clearly, they are French.' 

'No clothes, no shelter,' the Russian points out, 'they have only an apple to eat, and they're being told this is paradise. They are Russian.'
