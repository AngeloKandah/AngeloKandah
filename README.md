You Should Try To Be More Polite

One day, Bill and Tom went to a restaurant for dinner. As soon as the waiter took out two steaks, Bill quickly picked out the bigger steak for himself.

Tom wasn't happy about that: 'When are you going to learn to be polite?'

Bill: 'If you had the chance to pick first, which one would you pick?'

Tom: 'The smaller piece, of course.'

Bill: 'What are you whining about then? The smaller piece is what you want, right?'
