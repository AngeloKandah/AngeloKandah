The Crash

One day a man and a woman were driving and they get into a terrible collision with each other. Both cars are wrecked beyond recognition, but they both crawl out of the wreckage unhurt.
The woman says, 'In a terrible accident...both of us are alive and, well, this must be a sign from God!'
The man agrees.
The woman says, 'Well, we should celebrate our lives...here, let's drink to our celebration.' She reaches into her wreckage of her car and pulls out a bottle of champagne which miraculously was not broken or even cracked. The man takes a huge gulp of the wine and passes it to the woman who politely waves it away.
The man says, 'Don't you want any? It was your idea.'
The woman says, 'No thanks, I'll wait until the police get here.'
