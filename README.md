Made It!

Every day, Mr. Koch has to cross the river by ferry in order to get to work.

Waking up late one morning, he dressed quickly, ran out the door and raced to the dock. The boat was several yards away, and stepping back and taking a mighty leap, Mr. Koch landed with a crash on the deck.

'Made it!' he cried triumphantly.

'So?' said one of the passengers, 'What was the rush? The boat is coming in.'
