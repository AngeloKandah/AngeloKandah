Leprechauns

One day a man with a box walked in a bar. He sat down, opened the box and out popped a leprechaun. The man told the bartender, 'I want a pint of beer and a shot of whiskey for my buddy here.' 
There was man sitting at the end of the bar watching all of this and, after the leprechaun drank his shot of whiskey, he ran down to the end of the bar and spit in the guy's face, then he ran back. 

The guy with the box said, 'I'll have another beer and a shot of whiskey for my buddy here.' 

After the leprechaun drank his shot of whiskey, he again ran to the end of the bar and spit in the man's face, then dashed back. 

The guy with the box ordered another beer for himself and another shot for the leprechaun. Again, after the leprechaun drank his shot of whiskey, he ran down to the end of the bar. But this time the man was waiting for him and he grabbed the leprechaun and held him in the air. 

He said, 'If you spit in my face again, I'm going to cut your wiener off.' 

The leprechaun laughed and said, 'Leprechauns don't have wieners.' 

Then the man said, 'If you don't have wieners, then how do you pee?' 

'By spitting,' said the leprechaun.
