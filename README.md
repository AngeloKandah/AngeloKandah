Aren't They Good!

The university's gymnasium hallway displayed basketball team pictures from the past forty years.

In every photo, one player, sitting front row center, held a basketball identifying the year of the team: 94-95, 95-96, 96-97, 97-98, etc.

One day, a senior on the basketball team noticed a cute, blonde freshman cheerleader staring curiously at the photos. The senior, hoping to score a few points off the court, commented about the team's history.

Impressed, the cute, blonde freshman cheerleader said: 'Isn't it amazing how the teams always won by just one point?'
