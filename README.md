Personal Question

A guy walked up to a beautiful young woman in a bar. 'Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?' he said to her.

'I don't know,' replied the beautiful young woman. 'It depends how personal it is.'

'OK,' the guy said. 'How many men have you slept with?'

'I'm not going to tell you that!' the woman exclaimed. 'That's my business!'

'Sorry,' said the guy, 'I didn't realize you made a living out of it.'
