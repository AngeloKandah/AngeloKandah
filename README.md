Record Breaker

A man is just about to break a record. Suddenly, a dog jump up and bites him on the neck. 

Q: Is the dog owned by the former record keeper?
A: Yes.
Q: Did the former record keeper intend this to stop other people from breaking his record?
A: Yes. 

The murderer doesn't want other people to break his record. Therefore, he has trained his dog, so that when the dog hears someone speaking the last digits of pi that the murderer can recite, it will bite him to death.
