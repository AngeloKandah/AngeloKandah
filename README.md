Zero to 200

A couple had been debating buying a vehicle for weeks. He wanted a truck.
 
She wanted a fast little sports car so she could zip through traffic around town.
 
He would probably have settled on any beat up old truck, but everything she seemed to like was way out of their price range.
 
'Look!' she said, 'I want something that goes from 0 to 200 in just a few seconds. Nothing else will do. My birthday is coming up. so surprise me!'
 
He did just that, so for her birthday, he bought her a brand new bathroom scale.
 
Nobody has seen or heard from him since.
