Bang Head Here

Tech Support: 'All right. Now click 'OK'.'
Customer: 'Click 'OK'?'
Tech Support: 'Yes, click 'OK'.'
Customer: 'Click 'OK'?'
Tech Support: 'That's right. Click 'OK'.'
Customer: 'So I click 'OK', right?'
Tech Support: 'Right. Click 'OK'.'

Pause.

Customer: 'I clicked 'Cancel'.'
Tech Support: 'YOU CLICKED 'CANCEL'???'
Customer: 'That's what I was supposed to do, right?'
Tech Support: 'No, you were supposed to click 'OK'.'
Customer: 'I thought you said to click 'Cancel'.'
Tech Support: 'NO. I said to click 'OK'.'
Customer: 'Oh.'
Tech Support: 'Now we have to start over.'
Customer: 'Why?'
Tech Support: 'Because you clicked 'Cancel'.'
Customer: 'Wasn't I supposed to click 'Cancel'?'
Tech Support: 'No. Forget that. Let's start from the top.'
Customer: 'Ok.'

I spent the next fifteen minutes re-constructing the carefully crafted setup for this lady's unique computer.

Tech Support: 'All right. Now, are you ready to click 'OK'?'
Customer: 'Yes.'
Tech Support: 'Great. Now click 'OK'.'

Pause.

Customer: 'I clicked 'Cancel'.'

And people wonder why my mouse pad has a target on it labeled 'BANG HEAD HERE.'
