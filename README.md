Warren Peace

The social studies teacher had just completed a lesson on war and peace.

'How many of you,' the teacher asked, 'would say you're opposed to war?'

Not surprisingly, every student in the class raised their hand.

'Who would like to give us their reason for being opposed to war?' asked the teacher. Little Johnny, sitting at the back of the class, immediately raised his hand.

'Johnny, what is your reason?' the teacher asked.

'I hate wars,' explained Johnny, 'because wars make history, and I hate History!'
