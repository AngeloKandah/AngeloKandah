Restaurants

somewhere in Calfornia, USA, there is a man who want to open up a business. So he decided to build a restaurant. On the grand opening day, he put a large sign: 'BEST RESTAURANT IN CALIFORNIA'.

And there's another man do the same thing (make a new restaurant) close to the first man. He put a big sign: 'BEST RESTAURANT IN AMERICA'

There's another man also do the same thing. He's even more arrogant than the first two. He then put a big sign: 'BEST RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD'

ANOTHER man decided to do the same thing. But this man is wiser than the first three. So instead of put a bombastic sign, he only put a normal sign in front of his new restaurant: 'Best Restaurant on this road'
