The Quadriplegic

A man is walking down the docks when he sees a quadriplegic woman crying in a corner. Trying to be a nice guy he walks up and asks her what's wrong.

'I've never been hugged.' replies the woman. The man figures it would be a nice thing to do, so he picks her up and hugs her. She smiles. Then her face drops and she starts crying again.

'What's the matter now?' asks the man. 'I've never been kissed,' says the woman. The man leans down and kisses the woman on the lips for a brief moment. The woman smiles for a bit, then starts sobbing again.

The man, a bit annoyed, asks her again what's wrong. The woman replies, 'Because I don't have arms and legs I've never been screwed.'

The man picks up the woman and carries her down the dock, then tosses her off the side of the dock into the water.

The man yells at the woman, 'NOW YOU'RE SCREWED!'
