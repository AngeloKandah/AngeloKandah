Never pick up things from the floor...

There was a boy and a teacher walking down the street one day. The teacher bought the boy some gum and after chewing it for a while it fell out of his mouth. He went to pick it up and the teacher said, 'Never pick up things from the floor.'
     Then, the teacher bought him an ice cream. It fell on the floor and he went to pick it up. Again, the teacher said to him, 'Never pick up things from the floor.'
     Next, the teacher bought the boy a lollypop. It fell to the floor and once again he went to pick it up. The teacher told him, 'Never pick up things from the floor.'
     After walking down the street some more there was a ditch ahead, but neither the boy nor the teacher noticed it. As they walked on the teacher fell in and started yelling at the boy, 'Help me! Help me!
The boy just looked down at her and said, 'Never pick up things from the floor...'
