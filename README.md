The Parrot

A woman went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large, beautiful  parrot. There was a sign on the cage that read $50. 

'Why so little?' she asked the pet store owner. 

The owner looked at her and said, 'Look, I should tell you first ... that this bird used to live in a house of  prostitution, and sometimes he says some pretty vulgar stuff.' 

The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird anyway. She  took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room, and waited for it to say something. 

The bird carefully looked around the room, then it looked at her and said, 'New house ... new madam.' The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then thought, 'That's not so bad.'

 When her two teenage daughters returned from school the parrot looked at both of them, and said, 'New house ... new madam ... new hookers.' 

The girls were at first a bit offended, but then began to laugh about the whole situation. She then began to think about how to explain this to  Keith, her husband. 

Moments later, the woman's husband came home from  work. Before he had time to close the door, the bird took one look at him and said, 'Hi Keith.'
