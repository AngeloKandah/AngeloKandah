How to Shower Like a Woman

1. Take off clothing and place it in sectioned laundry hamper according to lights and darks.
2. Walk to bathroom wearing long dressing gown. If you see your husband along the way, cover up any exposed flesh and rush to the bathroom. 
3. Look at your womanly physique in the mirror and stick out your gut so that you can complain and whine even more about how you're getting fat. 
4. Get in the shower. Look for facecloth, armcloth, legcloth, long loofah, wide loofah and pumice stone. 
5. Wash your hair once with Cucumber and Lamfrey shampoo with 83 added vitamins. 
6. Wash your hair again with Cucumber and Lamfrey shampoo with 83 added vitamins.

8. Wash your face with crushed apricot facial scrub for 10 minutes until red and raw. 
9. Wash entire rest of body with Ginger Nut and Jaffa Cake body wash. 
10. Rinse conditioner off hair (take at least 15 minutes as you must make sure that it has all come off).
