Hiccups

A man goes into a drug store and asks the pharmacist if he can give him something for the hiccups. 
The pharmacist promptly reaches down, pulls out a knife, and lunges at the man.
The man backs away and yells 'WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?'
'Well, you don't have the hiccups anymore do you?' replies the pharmacist.
The man says, 'No I don't, you jerk; but my wife out in the car still does!'
