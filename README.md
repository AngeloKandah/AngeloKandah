What the Doc Means

'Well, what have we here...?' 
He has no idea and is hoping you'll give him a clue.

'Well, we're not feeling so well today, are we...?' 
I'm stalling for time. 

'If it doesn't clear up in a week, give me a call.' 
I don't know what it is. Maybe it will go away by itself. 

'Let me check your medical history.' 
I want to see if you've paid your last bill before spending anymore time with you. 

'Well, now, we have some good news and some bad news.' 
The good news is, I'm going to buy that new BMW. The bad news is, you're going to pay for it. 

'This should be taken care of right away.' 
I'd planned a trip to Hawaii next month but this is so easy and profitable that I want to fix it before it cures itself. 

'Let me schedule you for some lab tests.' 
I have a forty percent interest in the lab. 

'Let's see how it develops.' 
Maybe in a few days it will grow into something that really needs to be cured. 

'I'd like to prescribe a new drug.' 
I'm writing a paper and would like to use you for a guinea pig. 

'That's quite a nasty looking wound.' 
I think I'm going to throw up. 

'This may smart a little.' 
Last week two patients almost bit off their tongues. 

'This should fix you up.' 
The drug company slipped me some big bucks to prescribe this stuff. Hope it works... 

'Everything seems to be normal.' 
Rats! I guess I can't buy that new beach condo after all. 

'I'd like to run some more tests.' 
I can't figure out what's wrong. Maybe the kid in the lab can solve this one.
